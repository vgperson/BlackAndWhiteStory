I'm currently testing my way through the game using only the files in this repository.
Once I've translated everything I want to (the most major stuff I'll skip will be Wi-Fi stuff), I plan on posting a patch using these files, since I'll know everything is how I want it, particularly with names.
However, I have no problem with the ProjectPokemon patch using any of my translations.

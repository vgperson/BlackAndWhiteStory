Wow... As I thought, it's high...\xfffeAh... I may be getting scared...
Ugh... It's swaying... Isn't it? It is!\xfffeI'm scared of how high up we are...
Ahh... No, no... This is my limit.\xfffeHere... Sit a little closer, OK?
It's getting higher and higher...\xfffeUlp. This is going faster than I thought.
Oh! Come look here!\xfffeLook! Ulp, I'm not feeling so good...
... ... ... ... ... ...\xfffe... ... ... ... ... ...
I thought I'd enjoy this ride, but I feel\xfffelike I'm enclosed in a tiny little space...
Luckily, I'm not scared of heights.\xfffeThat would not be cool for a Hiker.
I'm gonna stay cool. Feel cool on the\xfffeinside, look cool on the outside.
Uh-oh. It's higher than I thought.\xfffeUlp. It's swaying more than I expected.
Oh! Don't move! We'll fall!\xfffeDo...not...move...

Just...just until we start to descend...\xfffePlease...stay...
Um-hmm...\xfffeSince we have time, shall we talk?
Um-hm... That's right... No way!\xfffeThen... Um-hmm... Yes, yes... Um-hm...

Yaaaay! So high up! Up in the sky!\xfffeHee hee. It's fun!
Look how far we can see!\xfffeLook! Please, Trainer?
The city is getting smaller and smaller...\xfffeSuch a pretty sight...
Krrf! Krrrf! Krrrf!\xfffeSorry... It's a bit chilly for me...

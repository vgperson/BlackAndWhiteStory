When a Trainer meets eyes\xfffewith another Trainer...\xf000븁\x0000There begins a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
What the?!\xfffeYou're that strong?!
Go into the grass to fight\xfffeagainst wild Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000But before that, you have to heal\xfffeyour Pokémon at a Pokémon Center.
I just LOVE Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000My lovey-dovey Pokémon\xfffeare gonna do their lovey-doviest!\xf000븁\x0000
But even if I lose,\xfffemy Pokémon are still adorable...!
I train my Pokémon by fighting\xfffewith all kinds of Trainers!
Yooterii! My Yooterii!\xfffeGOOO, YOOTERII!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa, your Pokémon\xfffecan use moves like THAT?!
All kinds of Trainers\xfffesend out all kinds of Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000It's exciting just to watch!
Hm, how well have I raised\xfffemy Pokémon? Please show me!\xf000븁\x0000
...Not quite...\xfffeenough, I guess.
Impressive...!\xfffeTake this present!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you very much!\xf000븁\x0000Battling you has shown me how\xfffeI should train from now on.
Your Pokémon!\xfffeThey radiate good vibes!\xf000븁\x0000Is it okay if I see\xfffehow you've raised them?\xf000븁\x0000
I see...! You've raised them\xfffeby traveling alongside them!
Here, give this\xfffeto your precious Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Through continued experiences,\xfffethe Pokémon you raise learn\xf000븁\x0000how to understand a Trainer's feelings\xfffewith a single glance!
I'm surrounded by so many smiles\xfffefrom kids and Pokémon both...\xf000븀\x0000I am UNSTOPPABLE!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa! Awesome stuff!\xfffeYou're really strong!
Looking an opponent in the eyes\xfffetells you their feelings...\xf000븀\x0000People and Pokémon are the same that way.
We'll combine our power and try hard,\xfffeso please look as us!\xf000븁\x0000
Kumi: Waaah! Pokémon,\xfffeyou should've tried harder!\xf000븁\x0000Lumi: Huhhh? Pokémon,\xfffeyou're not looking too good...
Maybe if we'd used a Potion mid-battle,\xfffewe could've won?
Huh? You've only got one Pokémon?\xfffeAnd you say you're a Trainer?
Uhhh...\xfffeOne plus one is two!\xf000븁\x0000
Huhhh? Pokémon,\xfffeyou're not looking too good...
Defeat one Pokémon in a Double Battle,\xfffeand victory becomes difficult.
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeBut you're a Trainer, right?
Hey, Trainer!\xfffeBattle with me, NOW!!\xf000븁\x0000
Waugh!\xfffeI'm out of usable Pokémon...
Dangit! Why'd you have to be\xfffeso harsh on a kid like me?!\xf000븀\x0000Not like I minded! Hehe!
Take THIS!\xfffeHYPER BEAM!!\xf000븁\x0000
Owowowww...!
Hyper Beam?\xfffeNah, I can't use stuff like that yet!\xf000븁\x0000I don't know much about Pokémon...\xfffeBut I still wanna use powerful moves!
Twainer!\xfffeI'mma be your opponent, otay?\xf000븁\x0000
Twainer...!\xfffeYou're super-duper stwong!
When I'mma get bigger,\xfffeI wanna be stwong like you, twainer!
It's time to use the knowledge\xfffeI gained at the Trainer's School!\xf000븁\x0000
Mugyuuu!
Your magnificence overwhelmed my\xfffeability to remember what I studied!\xf000븀\x0000Gotta keep my cool in battle...
I've been standing here and thinking\xfffeabout some new strategies!\xf000븁\x0000
I got too confused\xfffeabout how to battle...
They say there might be\xfffea rare Pokémon in shaking grass?\xf000븀\x0000The more you know!
Even yet-untrained Pokémon\xfffecan still demonstrate strength,\xf000븀\x0000given the Trainer fights with them right!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, such a pity!\xfffeI lost...
I feel bad when Pokémon lose\xfffebecause of their Trainer...\xf000븀\x0000Trainers bear a heavy responsibility!
The joy of journeying the world\xfffeis in meeting countless Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000Now let our Pokémon duel!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa! You, Trainer,\xfffeare THE BEST IN THE WORLD!\xf000븀\x0000...Maybe.
If you have Pokémon with you, you can\xfffebattle Trainers anywhere in the world!\xf000븁\x0000The world is huge! MAN!\xfffeI've got so much to look forward to!
Where did you come from?\xf000븁\x0000As for me... beat me in a battle,\xfffeand I'll tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, uh...\xfffeI lost my first battle...
I actually set out from\xfffeCastelia City just yesterday.\xf000븀\x0000That was my first Pokémon battle, too...
I'm still just a rookie,\xfffebut someday I'll be a super player!\xf000븁\x0000So I'm gonna keep on challenging\xfffepeople to Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
Gyack!\xfffeTriple failure, all the way!
It's NOT okay even if I lose!\xf000븁\x0000If I have time to lose, I'm better off\xfffeusing it to try to get better!
You there, youth! Adolescence is\xfffea great time to break a sweat, eh?!\xf000븁\x0000
Whew, I broke a sweat...\xfffeWell, it's okay for athletes, too!
I want a basketball-sized Poké Ball!\xf000븁\x0000I mean, that'd make bigger Pokémon\xfffefeel more comfortable inside, right?!
I'm a fascinating fishing hook,\xfffeand I've got you hook, line, and sinker!\xf000븁\x0000Lemme battle you with\xfffethe lively Pokémon I've caught!\xf000븁\x0000
The one reeled in...\xfffeWas me?!
I let Pokémon go right after catching 'em!\xfffeThat's called catch and release!\xf000븀\x0000And I say as I send them off...\xf000븁\x0000Goodbye, Pokémon!\xfffe'Twas a nice fight!!\xf000븁\x0000And to you, too!\xfffe'Twas a nice fight!!
Yeahhh!\xfffeI reeled in a biggun!\xf000븁\x0000Next I'll try to reel in\xfffethat trophy known as victory!\xf000븁\x0000
Man, I let a huge\xfffevictory get away...
I fish, I'm lured in, and I fish again...\xfffeLife is fishing!
Diggadiggadugga! Under construction!\xfffeBut I'll still battle a Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
Diggaduggadigga...\xfffeDiggadugga... I dig-dug myself into a hole...
If you use the move Dig,\xfffeyou can get out of caves in a jiffy!
I'm a macho, macho workman!\xfffeI'll beat you up! With my MUSCLES!\xf000븁\x0000
Hm!\xfffeYou've got spunk!
I misjudged you\xfffeas just some kid...\xf000븀\x0000but no, you're a fine Trainer!
As a middle-aged workman,\xfffemy jobs are construction and battling.\xf000븁\x0000
It may be my job,\xfffebut I'm not THAT good at it!
I lost in a battle,\xfffebut nobody'll beat me in construction!\xf000븁\x0000And it would seem you're\xfffesimilarly unbeatable!
We've been trained through physical labor!\xfffeGet a load of our powerful attacks!\xf000븁\x0000
We've been trained through physical labor,\xfffeso we're powerful even when we lose!
Being with my favorite Pokémon and\xfffegetting work done makes me so happy!
Oh, Trainer!\xfffeLet me show you true art!\xf000븁\x0000
I feel I am all out\xfffeof white paint...
This world has white, black,\xfffered, green, blue, yellow...\xf000븀\x0000and countless other colors.\xf000븁\x0000And so, to mix them all\xfffeand bring forth a new color...!\xf000븁\x0000Sha-ZAM!!
I'm in the mood, the wind is blowing, and\xfffeyou come into sight... it must be fate!\xf000븁\x0000
Ooh...\xfffeThe headwind blew me over...
I want to soar around the Unova region\xfffewith the wind blowing at my back!
There's... something inside this big bag...\xfffeWhat do you think it could be?\xf000븁\x0000
I may have lost,\xfffebut my bag continues to grow...
That which nearly overflows from my bag...\xfffeIt's the memories of my journey!\xf000븁\x0000Even invisible things can have\xfffeprofound weight to them!
Well! These Pokémon always\xfffehelp me with my baking!\xf000븁\x0000
My?!\xfffeWhat an aromatic battle...
Getting on with Pokémon, baking bread...\xf000븁\x0000It's just so much fun!\xfffeI get up early every day for it!
With a spin and a turn, it's my turn! ♪\xfffeWith a turn and a spin, it's your turn!\xf000븁\x0000
Round and round and round and round...
Battling in the midst of\xfffea casual dance is hard!\xf000븁\x0000But hey, I AM a dancer!\xfffeI gotta dance!
Your Pokémon's moves!\xfffeI ask you to show me them!\xf000븁\x0000
You have certainly shown me...\xfffeyou and your Pokémon's moves!
Some battles are so elegant\xfffeas to seem like love at first sight.\xf000븁\x0000My battle with you\xfffewas no doubt a contender!
I'm the best at whatever I do!\xfffeDon'tcha think so too?\xf000븁\x0000
The rhythm of my offense and defense\xfffewas slightly delayed...
A guitar itself can tell you some things,\xfffebut to truly get something out of it,\xf000븀\x0000you need to play the guitar!\xf000븁\x0000A Pokémon itself can tell you things...\xfffeand, well, we battle them!
The future remains to be seen...\xfffeThe world has not yet chosen it...
PLASMAAAAA!\xfffeWe lost?!
I can't believe Team Plasma\xfffewas done in by this lot...!
I've finally become a Trainer...\xfffeIt all starts here!
I'm not finished yet! This is the moment\xfffeI've been studying for!
...!\xfffeSo THIS is a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...\xfffeIt all starts here!
I'm not finished yet! This is the moment\xfffeI've been studying for!
...!\xfffeSo THIS is a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...\xfffeIt all starts here!
I'm not finished yet! This is the moment\xfffeI've been studying for!
...!\xfffeSo THIS is a Pokémon battle!
Yaaah!! That HUUURT!!\xfffeI'm not letting you do THAT again!!
Ooh, I'm making a mess of things...\xfffeI can't do this all that well!
...Regardless of the Pokémon,\xfffeI DID do my best, okay?!
Yaaah!! That HUUURT!!\xfffeI'm not letting you do THAT again!!
Ooh, I'm making a mess of things...\xfffeI can't do this all that well!
...Regardless of the Pokémon,\xfffeI DID do my best, okay?!
Yaaah!! That HUUURT!!\xfffeI'm not letting you do THAT again!!
Ooh, I'm making a mess of things...\xfffeI can't do this all that well!
...Regardless of the Pokémon,\xfffeI DID do my best, okay?!
More! Let me hear more\xfffefrom your Pokémon!
There are Pokémon who would\xfffesay such things...?!
My psychic Pokémon\xfffeseem somehow alarmed...\xf000븁\x0000Is it because we're in a ruin,\xfffeor are you the cause?\xf000븁\x0000
...Such power!\xfffeJust what are you?!
As many long years\xfffepassed over these ruins...\xf000븁\x0000People and Pokémon have\xfffegrown in number around Unova.
A mysterious power\xfffeis gathering here...\xf000븁\x0000
You, too, are full of\xfffethis mysterious power...
A mystical energy remains\xfffein historical locations...\xf000븁\x0000This I know.\xfffeThe many sorrows and joys...
You think that'll work\xfffeagainst my Pokémon?!
Not yet! Still got one more!\xfffeHere's where I get serious!
I give up...\xf000븁\x0000I am B-U-R-N-T O-U-T!
I see!\xfffeThat may indeed be a worthy attack.
I, Corn, shall put my all\xfffeinto using my last Pokémon!
I admit defeat...\xfffeI, Corn, have been beaten.
Ah!\xfffeMy Pokémon!
...Oh? Could it be\xfffeI'm down to one Pokémon?
...Er, is it over?
Welcome, welcome!\xfffeThis is Sanyou Gym!\xf000븁\x0000Here, you may feast upon\xfffethe basics of Pokémon battling!\xf000븁\x0000
Why...!\xfffeWhat a fantastic Trainer you are!
With an observation of type weaknesses\xfffeand well-trained Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000victory should be in your grasp.
Sanyou Gym prides itself upon\xfffea full course of Trainers!\xf000븀\x0000And I shall be your second helping!\xf000븁\x0000
Was my battle with you\xfffea satisfactory meal?
Sanyou Gym prides itself upon\xfffea full course of Trainers!\xf000븀\x0000The gym leader will be your last meal!
Aha, NOW I get to see\xfffewhat kind of Trainer you are!
Even in these circumstances,\xfffeI can find a way to win!
Now that was really something!\xfffeAin't you just charming!
I frequent Shippo Gym,\xfffeso people call me a bookworm.\xf000븁\x0000But trust me, I'm strong too!\xfffeI can both read a whole book\xf000븀\x0000and train a Pokémon in a day!\xf000븁\x0000
They call me a bookworm,\xfffebut I'm not a bug-type Pokémon!
My first recommendation\xfffeis "Hello, My Pokémon."\xf000븁\x0000It's on the shelf for children's books\xfffenear the entrance.
Wooooow!\xfffeI lost, but still, thanks for the battle!
Your strength...\xfffeIt surpasses my wisdom!
BISH!!\xfffeYou've hit the switch of my soul!!
Let us further... the bug spirit!\xfffeNo, no, I don't mean it like that!
Ooh...?!\xfffeCould this be the end?!
You and your Pokémon...\xfffethey're shining gorgeously!
Well, things have to look bad\xfffebefore there can be a dramatic victory!
I was planning on dizzying you,\xfffebut you've dazzled me instead!
Even if I lose,\xfffeI won't throw a tantrum... okay?
Welcome, challenger!\xf000븁\x0000Let I, the rich boy,\xfffebe your opponent!\xf000븁\x0000
Arrrrrrrrrrgh!\xfffeThe R is for rollercoaster!
I was going to overwhelm you\xfffewith a speedy fighting style, but...!\xf000븁\x0000Simply moving faster than your\xfffeopponent gives you an advantage!
I lost, but thinking back on it,\xfffeI still think I got stronger...
Your fashion...\xfffeThere's no doubt, it's Kanoko Town-ish!\xf000븁\x0000
Inconceivable! Shouldn't my\xfffesuperior fashion have overwhelmed you...?!
You, too, should become a fan of\xfffethe dazzling Raimon's dazzling gym's\xf000븀\x0000dazzling leader, Ms. Camille!
...Ho now!\xfffeThat's how it'll be, huh?
It's fine by me if ya wanna\xfffegive up anytime, y'know!
Well, I give up... And keep in mind\xfffeI wasn't goin' easy on ya!
Just what kind of Trainer are you, I wonder?\xfffeI'm getting pretty excited over here!
It's my last Pokémon...\xfffewhich means I can't give up here!
I feel stronger just battling\xfffewith you... thanks!
I've longed to be a pilot\xfffesince I was just a little kid...\xf000븀\x0000My power is flawless! Have at you!\xf000븁\x0000
Slowly lowering altitude...\xfffeMaking preparations for landing...
My dream of becoming a pilot\xfffewas made reality...\xf000븀\x0000That makes me feel so great!
I've taken aim!\xf000븁\x0000I'll do circles around you\xfffewith my flight technique!\xf000븁\x0000
What the?!\xfffeMy aim was off...
I rely most heavily\xfffeon moves with perfect accuracy.\xf000븁\x0000For example, Aerial Ace and Swift!
Deep in the freezer storage, one man\xfffeuses the coldest of cold Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000That would be me!\xf000븁\x0000
I give up!\xfffeMaybe I should train at Sekka Gym...
The gym leader of Sekka City\xfffeuses ice-type Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000If I train both mind and body there,\xfffeI'll come to be cool with the cool!
The freezer storage is freezing!\xf000븁\x0000Do you find it refreshing?\xfffeWell, savor it!\xf000븁\x0000
Brrrrr?!\xfffeMy spine's not just shivering, it's frozen!
Even this freezer storage\xfffeis loaded with Trainers!
Temp Message\xf000븁\x0000
Temp Message
Temp Message
We...! Are in the midst\xfffeof training here!\xf000븁\x0000Hey! You should train your\xfffePokémon together with us!\xf000븁\x0000
Wooooow!\xfffeYou're such a talented Trainer!
I wanted to beat the gym leader...\xfffeBut I wanted to beat you, too!
My goal is to surpass the gym leader!\xfffeYou think you can beat me?!\xf000븁\x0000
Listen up, my Pokémon!\xfffeWe did our best!
I have a goal in sight!\xfffeI have Pokémon here for me!\xf000븀\x0000So I shall go to the ends of the earth!
POWER!!\xf000븁\x0000In Pokémon and in football,\xfffepower is LIFE!!\xf000븁\x0000
I didn't have enough power...?
I train with my Pokémon every day\xfffelooking to become the strongest!
An elegant tennis player can\xfffefight an equally elegant battle!\xf000븁\x0000
E-Even when I lose,\xfffeI won't lose my cool!
I-I am a lady,\xfffes-so I shall not be mortified!
The primaries are soon!\xf000븁\x0000You be my wall, and let's do\xfffesome SMASHING practice!\xf000븁\x0000
Pant! Pant, pant, pant...\xfffeThat was some good training...
You and I just met,\xfffeand we're already in competition!
One-two, one-two! Ah! Breathing\xfffein and out! Face our one-two PUNCH!\xf000븁\x0000
Mayo: But we synced our breathing!\xfffeHUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH?!?\xf000븁\x0000Maya: But we synced our breathing!\xfffeHUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH?!?
But we should've been way better\xfffeworking with two Pokémon!
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeWell then, we can't battle.
We're having a meeting before the battle\xfffeto decide what to do!\xf000븁\x0000
But we synced our breathing!\xfffeHUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH?!?
I've been taught that\xfffewhen your ally is floating,\xf000븀\x0000it's okay to use Earthquake!
If you're going to battle us,\xfffeyou'll need two Pokémon.
...You're getting in the way!\xfffeYou awful, awful Trainer!
What's taken will be returned...\xfffeGot it? And don't forget it...!
Hey, look!\xfffeIt's the Sanyou City gym badge!\xf000븁\x0000Oh, you have it too!\xfffeBut who's better?\xf000븀\x0000Let's Pokémon battle it out!\xf000븁\x0000
Nice! Battling people with\xfffegym badges is way different!
You know there's a symbol\xfffenear the gym entrance, right?\xf000븁\x0000When you get a gym badge,\xfffeyour name is written there!
I patrol Yaguruma Forest\xfffeday after day!\xf000븀\x0000It's my job to battle you here!\xf000븁\x0000
...Losing in Yaguruma Forest\xfffemeans I've failed in my duty!
A Ranger always carries one of these...\xfffeI'll give it to you...!\xf000븁\x0000
The forest is alive...\xf000븁\x0000Every day, something seems to change,\xfffeso patrolling is all the more enjoyable!
Blending into the wild to\xfffespeak to the hearts of Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000That's being a Pokémon Ranger!!\xf000븁\x0000
Did you feel my wildness?
I think you can\xfffehandle using this...\xf000븁\x0000
Blend too much into the wild,\xfffeand of course, people won't\xf000븀\x0000notice you among the Pokémon.\xf000븀\x0000That can be a problem...
Okay! Let's take\xfffea deep breath together!\xf000븁\x0000Breeeeeathe... haaah...\xfffeBreeeeeathe... haaah...\xf000븁\x0000Okay! Next,\xfffelet's battle Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
In this state of affairs...\xfffeAll I can manage is a sigh.
Take this from me, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Various Pokémon are\xfffein various places...\xf000븁\x0000Does that mean everyone\xfffehas a particular place?
Without disturbing Mother Nature...\xfffeWe grow more powerful.\xf000븀\x0000That's the strength of a Ranger!\xf000븁\x0000
You, too, join forces\xfffewith your Pokémon!
Take a small part of the power\xfffeI've received from Mother Nature.\xf000븁\x0000
Even things you can't do alone,\xfffeif you have someone with you...\xf000븁\x0000Right! We always have\xfffePokémon at our side...\xf000븀\x0000What a wonderful world!
Why are Pokémon\xfffeand people together...?\xf000븀\x0000That's the topic of my research!\xf000븁\x0000
I feel as if... a single ray\xfffeof light has come through.
Why are Pokémon\xfffeand people together...?\xf000븁\x0000I hypothesize that it is\xfffebecause of their differences.
If you make use of what you\xfffehave learned, you too may win!\xf000븁\x0000
But I've even\xfffebeaten my teacher before...
Knowing and doing seem similar,\xfffebut are actually very different.
My Pokémon are awesome!\xfffeBattle 'em and you'll know why!\xf000븁\x0000
So... hey! Did you get\xfffewhy my Pokémon are so awesome?!
My Pokémon are awesome because...!\xf000븁\x0000Um...\xf000븁\x0000I dunno, I have a bunch?
Bundle up when it's cold!\xfffe'Tis the wisdom of humans!\xf000븁\x0000
Mischief in the finale of the finale...\xfffePerhaps 'tis too the wisdom of humans...
I'll teach you some wisdom.\xf000븁\x0000When a Pokémon is frozen, use fire-type\xfffemoves to thaw the ice!
Even in the freezing freezer storage,\xfffemy heart... IS ON FIREEEEE!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa-oh...?!
While there are Pokémon who\xfffecan be just as peppy in the cold,\xf000븀\x0000others prefer warmth instead.\xf000븁\x0000Yep! All people are different,\xfffeand so are Pokémon!
You're an enthusiastic kid\xfffefor coming to such a cold place!\xf000븁\x0000Let's Pokémon battle\xfffeand warm ourselves up!!\xf000븁\x0000
I was warmed up,\xfffebut my heart shivers with defeat...
To strengthen myself against the cold,\xfffeI'm building up warm fat!\xf000븁\x0000...So I'm not just letting myself go.\xfffeDon't get me wrong, okay?
... ... ...\xfffe... ... Buh-battle?\xf000븁\x0000
... ... ...\xfffe... ...I'm sh-shivering...
... ... ...\xfffe... ...D-Did you know?\xf000븀\x0000... ...It's c-cold here.
A journeying backpacker\xfffeand a journeying Trainer... we match!\xf000븁\x0000
Perhaps I set out on my journey\xfffeto meet you? Hmm...
For the first time in my journey\xfffeI've realized something...\xf000븁\x0000Just going somewhere isn't a journey.\xfffeWho you meet... what you learn...\xf000븀\x0000That's all part of my journey.
I wanted to go to the Tower of Heaven...\xfffeBut I'm lost, so I'm just sitting here.\xf000븁\x0000
I see! Just sitting here\xfffewon't get me anywhere!
To reach the Tower of Heaven...\xf000븁\x0000Just walk along the path!\xf000븁\x0000Right! Just keep walking, and\xfffeone day, you'll arrive at your goal!
Oh! A Pokédex!\xf000븁\x0000I see... so that's\xfffethe reason for your journey!\xf000븁\x0000
Impressive!\xfffeBut of course, you DO have a Pokédex!
Actually, I heard a rumor that\xfffefather and daughter Professor Juniper\xf000븀\x0000were backpackers in their youth...
Who's traveling with me?\xfffeWhy, the Pokémon recommended by\xf000븀\x0000this popular guidebook!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, the guidebook\xfffedoesn't tell you how to win...
According to this guidebook,\xfffeRaimon City is a town full of amusement!\xf000븀\x0000I'm sure it's loaded with fun times!
You're passing through?\xf000븁\x0000Then you better greet me!\xf000븁\x0000
Why, you!\xfffeYou're really tough!
A kid like you would be\xfffebetter with a bike!\xf000븀\x0000It's healthier for you!
Heh! I ain't losin' to anybody\xfffewith my wild speed!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh, I lost!\xfffeI look so unrad!
Ahhh! If only I had\xfffea way wider road, I'd've totally...\xf000븀\x0000And my Pokémon'd love it, too!
Hey-hey! Yooooo-hooooo!\xf000븁\x0000Seems ya got some good Pokémon!\xfffeCome on, show 'em off to me!\xf000븁\x0000
Jim: R... Real good!\xfffeImpressive, actually!\xf000븁\x0000Sub: What the?!\xfffeBut we're too bad to lose...
Ya got good Pokémon,\xfffeor ya got bad Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000But it all depends on the Trainer...\xfffe'swhat I think!
You only got one Pokémon?\xfffeI ain't gonna fight a battle that boring!
Hey there!\xf000븁\x0000When bad and bad unite...\xfffeyou know what that means?\xf000븁\x0000It means REALLY bad!\xf000븁\x0000
What the?!\xfffeBut we're too bad to lose...
Even bad dudes like us\xfffehave fellowship!\xf000븁\x0000Got that...?\xfffeMan-to-man fellowship,\xf000븀\x0000and fellowship with Pokémon...
What the?\xfffeYou only got one Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000A two-on-one\xfffejust ain't fair!
I'm sorta tough, so ya better know\xfffehow to handle me!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, nuts...
You're pretty tough...\xfffeBetter than the little league!
Hey there!\xfffeWanna be my practice partner?!\xf000븁\x0000But keep in mind,\xfffeI'm serious about my practice!\xf000븁\x0000
I was no match...\xfffeSo there's someone better than the best!
I promise...\xf000븁\x0000I'll overcome this defeat,\xfffeand I'll be a much better battler!
There is no end\xfffeto the art of mastering Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
There IS an end\xfffeto Pokémon battles!
It can be hard doing an endless task,\xfffebut thinking of it another way,\xf000븀\x0000it means you can enjoy it forever!
I fight because I want to understand\xfffethe feelings of my fighting Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000This is why I am BATTLE GIRL!\xf000븁\x0000
When I'm beaten, I cry with my Pokémon!\xfffeThis is why I am BATTLE GIRL!
Every day I train so that\xfffemy body moves just as I wish!\xf000븀\x0000Do you know how nice that feels?
Together with my Pokémon,\xfffeI push rocks with my fists!\xf000븁\x0000The accumulation of steady,\xfffeone-by-one punches works best!\xf000븁\x0000
We still haven't\xfffebuilt up enough punches!
Together with my Pokémon,\xfffeI push rocks with my fists!\xf000븁\x0000How about you try pushing rocks\xfffewith your own fighting-type Pokémon?
Hello, nice to meet you!\xf000븁\x0000There are the kinds of\xfffePokémon I have with me!\xf000븁\x0000
Well! Now I've gotten\xfffea good look at your Pokémon!
Oh yes, you are most strong!\xfffeI yearn to be like you!\xf000븀\x0000I wish to be your apprentice!
The greeting for businessmen\xfffeis the trading of business cards, but...\xf000븁\x0000The greeting for fellow Trainers\xfffeis, of course, Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
A magnificent greeting...\xfffeI mean, what magnificent Pokémon!
I, too, journeyed with Pokémon\xfffewhen I was a child...\xf000븁\x0000Of course, I still train\xfffePokémon to this day!\xf000븀\x0000They're lifelong friends!
It is my job!\xfffeIt is my job to Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Things didn't go so well\xfffeat work today...
My company develops goods\xfffefor Pokémon and Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000So Pokémon battling is\xfffean important part of the job!
I've relentlessly trained\xfffemyself against Mr. Yacon!\xf000븁\x0000Comparing me to the other Trainers\xfffewouldn't even be fair!\xf000븁\x0000
Arrrrrgh...\xfffeTHIS isn't even fair...
Mr. Yacon is both a gym leader\xfffeand the manager of a company...\xf000븀\x0000It always makes me so mad!
I was gonna take a little break,\xfffebut then you came into my life!\xf000븁\x0000
Our meeting was\xfffecertainly good for you!
It's been over ten years\xfffesince I met my Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000We're partners who share our souls.
Even a lost battle\xfffecan be a bittersweet memory...
Ohhh!\xfffeWhy, what a tough Trainer!!
When you meet a Pokémon Trainer,\xfffeyou must naturally have a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Gyahhh...\xfffeI'm no good at this...
Even meeting someone here...\xfffecould it be part of her guidance?
Oh? You'd fight an old lady?\xf000븁\x0000No, it's fine!\xfffeFor I have strong Pokémon with me!\xf000븁\x0000
...So I see.\xfffeShe's gone now...
...She's gone now.\xf000븁\x0000...No, that's not right.\xfffeAs long as I don't forget her,\xf000븀\x0000we'll always, always be together.
If you want me to,\xfffeI'll heal up your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000However! First, I ask you\xfffeto have a bout with me!\xf000븁\x0000
What the?! The Pokémon who\xfffelost their fighting fitness... were mine?!
Well then, as promised.\xfffeLet me heal your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
To truly make everyone healthy,\xfffea doctor must go everywhere.
...Seeing you've come such a\xfffelong way makes me a happy doctor.\xf000븁\x0000Battle me and win,\xfffeand I'll recover your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Even if I didn't heal you,\xfffeyou'd be plenty energetic!
After a Pokémon battle,\xfffemake sure to take it easy and heal.\xf000븁\x0000
Health is top priority wherever you go!\xfffeReally, it's very important.
I've held out through countless fierce\xfffebattles with my Pokémon partners!\xf000븁\x0000I DOUBT I'll lose to you!\xf000븁\x0000
Wait, YOU held out\xfffethrough the fierce battle?!
Well, I'm not giving in...\xf000븁\x0000I'll just get stronger with my partners\xfffe'til I can hold out to the end!
I've found a thus-far consistent\xfffepattern to victory! Take THIS!\xf000븁\x0000
Huh...\xfffeWell, that sucks.
The sadness of loss is only momentary!\xf000븁\x0000If I, the Trainer, give up,\xfffemy Pokémon can't do anything!
Do you have the potential to aim\xfffefor the Pokémon League? Let me see!\xf000븁\x0000
Aha! Aha aha!\xfffeAha-aha-aha-aha-aha! I see!
I hear there's a powerful\xfffeChampion at the Pokémon League.\xf000븁\x0000I hope that I, too, will someday be\xfffeable to challenge the Pokémon League!
I am an Ace Trainer!\xfffeThat said, yes, I'm very strong.\xf000븁\x0000If you were to beat me,\xfffeit would shake all of Unova!\xf000븁\x0000
...The value of my being is\xfffereally starting to shake down!
Your very existence will soon\xfffemake all of Unova shake!\xf000븁\x0000Even if I lost, at least I got to\xfffeshow off while fighting you!
Heyyy! My Pokémon rock!\xfffeLookit 'em!!\xf000븁\x0000
Waaaugh!!
People call me an "ace," but\xfffethat doesn't seem... right, y'know?\xf000븁\x0000I just wanna be strong\xfffe'cause I like Pokémon!
Just like the flow of electricity,\xfffeI can be anywhere, even here!\xf000븀\x0000And if challenged, I can respond!\xf000븀\x0000That's why I'm an Ace Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
Ooh...\xfffeI'm paralyzed...!
Here's some electrivia!\xf000븁\x0000Current flows from plus to minus,\xfffeelectrons flow from minus to plus!\xf000븀\x0000It goes both ways! That's nuts!
Electricity must flow if you're to\xfffetrain Pokémon you're partners with...\xf000븀\x0000So it comes even to this cave!\xf000븁\x0000
The running electricity...\xfffeIt zapped me...!
Electricity flows in the Pokémon\xfffewho choose to live in this cave...\xf000븁\x0000Don't you think it might be\xfffesmarter for people to not come in?
When facing off against a strong foe,\xfffeI pass them up and show my power!\xf000븁\x0000You look strong!\xfffeI'll have to pass you up!\xf000븁\x0000
I couldn't even catch up...\xfffeYou're not anything ordinary!!
No time to lament my loss!\xf000븁\x0000But once you get stronger,\xfffeyou can mope all you like.
What really delights the sleeping\xfffespirits is a heated Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Your burning spirit gleams!
Upon coming to the Tower of Heaven,\xfffeI had a desire to battle a marvel...\xf000븁\x0000Is this what it is to live?
I'm here because I want to know\xfffeabout the end of the world, but...\xf000븁\x0000If we battle,\xfffeperhaps we'll learn something...?\xf000븁\x0000
Could this be...\xfffeThe End?
If not people nor Pokémon...\xfffebut only the world alone vanishes,\xf000븀\x0000that will not be the end.\xf000븀\x0000That's what I feel from being here.
I'm filled with an\xfffeindescribable energy!\xf000븁\x0000
The energy's dropping...\xfffeByoo-byoo-byoo-byoo...
The world has many kinds of\xfffeenergies flowing around in it.\xf000븀\x0000Like hopes, like dreams...
...I still want to fight!\xfffeThat, the wandering spirits whisper!\xf000븁\x0000
Pant, pant...\xfffeAnd I want to calm down for a bit...
The Tower of Heaven...\xfffeit's filled with various feelings,\xf000븀\x0000with particular reasons to desire life.
When I do my practice,\xfffeI really feel I've become amazing!\xf000븀\x0000You know the feeling?\xf000븀\x0000So! Let's battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Taka: ...That didn't\xfffego very well at all!\xf000븁\x0000Shige: ...That didn't\xfffego well whatsoever!
Performing difficult tasks\xfffeas if they were simple...\xf000븁\x0000That's what's impressive\xfffeabout professionals!
I can't fight a\xfffetwo-on-one battle!
After playing as a team\xfffein a variety of sports...\xf000븁\x0000I want to try fighting\xfffeas a team, too!\xf000븁\x0000
...That didn't\xfffego very well at all!
Teamwork is often difficult...\xf000븁\x0000But once you know\xfffewhat your partners are thinking,\xf000븀\x0000you can do more fantastic things!
I want to try a\xfffePokémon battle as a team!
Whew! Just coming into\xfffethis stadium's gotten me excited!!\xf000븁\x0000
Hiro: Way overexcited!\xf000븁\x0000Shin: How exciting!\xfffeI'm feeling just ecstatic!
Just being here! Just looking around!\xfffeIt really riles me up!\xf000븁\x0000Having a game here...\xfffemust be outrageously exciting!
I don't want to\xfffefight a two-on-one battle!
When you fight in the stadium,\xfffeyou come to understand the feelings\xf000븀\x0000of the star players!\xf000븁\x0000
How exciting!\xfffeI'm feeling just ecstatic!
Fighting with my Pokémon\xfffein the stadium...\xf000븁\x0000I'm happy to get a taste of\xfffewhat it's like to be a star!
One on two?\xfffeWell, I'm not fighting that!
When people practice,\xfffethey want to get their body moving!\xf000븁\x0000Sooo... Let us both\xfffepractice our Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Taku: Even though I lost,\xfffeI'll laugh because I loved it!\xf000븁\x0000Yasu: Ah! I wasn't backing up\xfffemy Pokémon enough!
Watching people practice\xfffeisn't nearly as fun\xf000븀\x0000as battling for yourself!
I can't fight a\xfffetwo-on-one battle...
I'm usually just providing backup,\xfffebut today I'll be brave!\xf000븀\x0000Let's try a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah! I wasn't backing up\xfffemy Pokémon enough!
I'm no good at sports,\xfffebut I work hard providing backup,\xf000븀\x0000so I still enjoy them!
I'm not even talking to you\xfffeif you've only got one Pokémon!
Watching the players\xfffetrain with their Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000makes me want to battle, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Mana: Whoooa!\xfffeYou're just like a pro!!\xf000븁\x0000Sae: Do I know you from somewhere?!
Huh...! People who can fight\xfffeas skillfully as the pro players...\xf000븀\x0000well, of course they're tough!
We are two!\xfffeAnd so are our Pokémon!
My Pokémon do things\xfffewhich I can't do for me.\xf000븁\x0000How fantastic are you?\xfffeShould I know you?\xf000븁\x0000
Do I know you from somewhere?!
I've found a new charm to sports\xfffein my forming a Pokémon team!
You sure that's enough Pokémon?
You! Tennis or basketball!\xfffeWhich one do you like better?\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: The match ended before\xfffeI knew what was going on...!\xf000븁\x0000Yuki: You and your Pokémon\xfffemake an amazing team!!
I love tennis AND basketball!\xf000븁\x0000But which Pokémon do I like?\xfffeThat, I can't possibly answer!
Huh?!\xfffeOnly one usable Pokémon?!
We're together, always and forever!\xfffeAnd we've always had great teamwork!\xf000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon\xfffemake an amazing team!!
A tag battle where you're in sync\xfffewith your partner and Pokémon is hard!\xf000븁\x0000But if you're good at it,\xfffeit can be super exciting!
Only one of your Pokémon\xfffeis healthy enough...?
A true fisherman\xfffehas a quick temper!\xf000븀\x0000So let's BATTLE already!!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost!\xfffeIt's ALL OVER!!
Why would true fishermen\xfffehave quick tempers?\xf000븁\x0000If they don't catch any Pokémon,\xfffethey get irritated!
KIDS! Meet mah POKéMON!\xfffeThey're recoverin', so be nice, GOT IT?!\xf000븁\x0000
My tacklin' rockin' Pokémon\xfffeshoulda CRUSHLED ya...
Ah'm takin' a LONG break\xfffe'cause-a INJURIES from INTENSE GAMIN'!
Hey! Join our team!\xf000븁\x0000I meant join, or I'll MAKE you!\xf000븁\x0000
Never mind, you're too strong!\xfffeIt'd just be unfair!
We are SUPERB!\xf000븁\x0000We're toughin' it out day after\xfffeevery day! That's a lotta days!
If we win,\xfffewe get your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
It was just a joke!\xfffeDon't look at me like that!
Hmph! We're not so low as to\xfffesteal Pokémon like Team Plasma!
Wahaha! My hobby is standing\xfffehere and picking off the Trainers\xf000븀\x0000heading toward Victory Road!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, what the...!
Do you aim for something higher\xfffethan the joy of defeating someone...?\xf000븁\x0000Perhaps the Pokémon League\xfffeis where such people gather...
Words are USELESS!\xfffeLet us fight, and we shall understand!\xf000븁\x0000
... ... ...\xfffe... ... ...
Without a single word,\xfffewe convey feelings with Pokémon!
I have been trained with much training!\xfffeAnd my Pokémon...? EVEN MORE TRAINED!!\xf000븁\x0000
ORAORAORAORA!\xfffeI lost, but I'm still energetic!
My fighting Pokémon!\xfffeThey train by breaking boulders!
You are strong!\xfffeNo, rather, your Pokémon are strong!
I shall try you at my limits!\xfffeYou shall be schooled!
You and your Pokémon...!\xfffeThey are a stellar combination!\xf000븀\x0000What a beautiful friendship you've built!
When Pokémon get hurt...\xfffeI feel the same way!
Hold up! Just one SECOND!\xfffeWe're still gonna FIGHT, here!!
Whewww...\xfffeI totally wore myself out there...\xf000븀\x0000And we still lost!
...So you'd do that?\xfffeYes, you seem a tough opponent...
Well now! This is a do or die moment...\xfffeMay my ancestors' blood flow in me!!
I'm worn out, but\xfffeboiling over with emotions...\xf000븀\x0000What can I say...?
Nyah-nyah-nyah!\xf000븁\x0000Let's play, on my mark!\xfffeGet set... BATTLE!\xf000븁\x0000
Thanks for the battle!
Nyah-nyah-nyah!\xf000븁\x0000That's me trying to imitate\xfffethe Pokémon that lives with me!
Victory Road!\xf000븁\x0000Do I have the capability to climb it?\xfffeI'll check with you!!\xf000븁\x0000
Mmm...\xfffeStill too early, I guess!
Victory Road!\xfffeAn impressive obstacle!\xf000븁\x0000Of course, it DOES lead\xffferight into the Pokémon League!
Life is tough for hikers\xfffeloitering around in caves!\xf000븀\x0000Let me teach to you\xf000븀\x0000the difficulty of Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
...The peak of our battle\xfffealready passed?
When you're in a cave...\xfffeAnd you see the ground swell up...\xf000븀\x0000There's likely a Pokémon there!
Conquering the mountains\xfffemeans conquering YOU!\xf000븁\x0000Can you beat my Pokémon,\xfffescalers of countless mountains?!\xf000븁\x0000
I, like a mountain,\xfffehave been conquered!
Hikers seek the summit...\xf000븁\x0000Pokémon Trainers seek\xfffethe Pokémon League!
Do you require nursing?\xf000븁\x0000Very well, if you defeat me,\xfffeI'll restore your Pokémon to health!\xf000븁\x0000
Why!\xfffeYou seem healthy enough already!
Right! Well, then...\xfffeThe gift of health!\xf000븁\x0000
It's wonderful how many people and\xfffemany Pokémon can do many things!\xf000븁\x0000And of course, what I do\xfffeis bring Pokémon to health!
Welcome to\xfffethe Battle Company!\xf000븁\x0000Seeing as you came here,\xfffenaturally you won't mind a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Huh! Don't you think\xfffeyou're a little too harsh?!
The work of the Battle Company\xfffeis to make strong people stronger!
Oohoohoo! I'm more proud of\xfffemy Pokémon than my work!\xf000븁\x0000
But I'm so proud of my Pokémon...!
Of course, my work comes first.\xf000븁\x0000But I'm a tough gal! I can make\xfffemy Pokémon strong on top of that!
Mr. Yacon lies at\xfffethe bottom of the gym...\xf000븀\x0000But let me see if your skill\xf000븀\x0000is sufficient to meet him!\xf000븁\x0000
...Oh, no!\xfffeYou're really strong, huh?
I've only been into Pokémon\xfffesince I became an adult...\xf000븀\x0000But I'm REALLY into it!
Splash, spray, falling rain! ♪\xfffeCrash, play, fighting Pokémon! ♪\xf000븁\x0000
Rain pours down\xfffein a sorrowful melody...
The rain plays the\xfffefantastic melody of nature! ♪
I'm splashing about with my Pokémon!\xfffeYou wanna play with us?\xf000븁\x0000
Aww... I lost...\xfffeBut I had fun, so I'm satisfied!
I'm splashing about with my Pokémon!\xfffeThere's nothing so pleasant as that!\xf000븁\x0000I'm only apart from my Pokémon...\xfffea hundred percent of NEVER!
Splish, splash!\xfffeThat's what your footsteps sound like!\xf000븀\x0000Aw, that's adorable!\xf000븁\x0000
Okay, I think you're kinda\xfffetoo strong to be cute!
I divine from the sound of your steps...\xf000븁\x0000That you, splish-splashing Trainer,\xfffeare quite adored by Pokémon!
Spinning my parasol around,\xfffelike a flower blooming in the rain!\xf000븁\x0000
Uh...\xfffeWHAT!!
On rainy days, you can carry an\xfffeumbrella, wear a coat, or get soaked...\xf000븀\x0000Anything, so long as you like it!
I am a privileged youth, thus...\xfffeI have Pokémon of the highest quality!\xf000븁\x0000
I am a privileged youth, thus,\xfffeeven if I lose, I feel no regret! Hmph!
I am a privileged youth, thus...\xfffeI'm going to go on a shopping spree!
I'm resting after shopping 'til I dropped,\xfffebut I'd still enjoy a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
But...! When I'm shopping, I don't\xfffeback down on a haggle or a battle!
The shopping mall's wide inventory\xfffeis most satisfcatory to wealthy me!\xf000븀\x0000I want this, that, everything!
Let me show you how healthy\xfffeI am simply from being here!\xf000븁\x0000
NATURE!
If you use this,\xfffemight it make Pokémon healthy?\xf000븁\x0000
Being surrounded by all this green\xfffefills me with energy!\xf000븀\x0000Thanks, Mother Nature!
I'm breathing great!\xf000븁\x0000Let me show you what a Ranger\xfffeis with an astonishing combination!\xf000븁\x0000
I've been taught\xfffemuch about you!
I wonder, do you know\xfffeabout this berry?\xf000븁\x0000
Listen to the whisper of nature...!\xf000븁\x0000You might hear Pokémon\xfffeand plants breathing!
As nature changes its seasons,\xfffewe change how we dress...\xf000븀\x0000I consider that important!\xf000븁\x0000
Okey-doke! Looks like\xfffeyou consider nature important!
When the seasons change,\xfffenature gives us this!\xf000븁\x0000
Nature changes seasons,\xfffeand Pokémon evolve...\xf000븁\x0000So how can people change?
I've been growing fine trees\xfffefor twenty... no, thirty years!\xf000븁\x0000Shall we have a Pokémon battle\xfffeto delight in the trees?\xf000븁\x0000
I gave it my all...\xfffeThat's enough for me!
Take what the trees have given me!\xf000븁\x0000
Growing just a single tree\xfffeis a matter of much patience!\xf000븁\x0000So too is training Pokémon\xfffewith an unfading passion...
Time for us to debut with our\xfffeharmonious style of nature and Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Our style didn't catch on?!
What's your style when it comes\xfffeto giving Pokémon items to hold?\xf000븁\x0000
You have to make up\xfffeyour own style first thing!\xf000븁\x0000It's handy for making do\xfffewith your surroundings!
Lurking among the plants,\xfffewe display our power...\xf000븀\x0000See the magnificence of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
It wasn't YOUR magnificence\xfffeI was planning to see...
Pokémon love this...\xfffeYou should have it!\xf000븁\x0000
It's wonderful how both nature and cities\xfffehave all sorts of their own things!\xf000븁\x0000Pokémon and people can\xfffechoose their preferred places!
HMMM! You've piqued my interest!\xfffeAssist me in examining you!\xf000븁\x0000
HMMM! It's hard to\xfffeget results via this method...
The wind blows, and seeds fly...\xf000븁\x0000Seeds fly, and flowers bloom...\xf000븁\x0000Flowers bloom, and make seeds!\xf000븁\x0000Everything is connected!
Being a researcher,\xfffeI like to think I'm very diligent!\xf000븁\x0000
Huh-WHAAA?! No. WAY!\xfffeI CAN'T have lost!!
Making outrageous ideas\xfffeinto reality...\xf000븁\x0000It doesn't make me think science\xfffeso much as it does freedom!
Oh! An unsuspecting passerby!\xf000븁\x0000Lend me a hand!\xfffeFor scientific purposes, of course!\xf000븁\x0000
Results...\xfffeAsked for a hand, got a fistful!
Does science make everyone happy?\xfffeAlas, I don't really know...\xf000븁\x0000But if I believe it can do so,\xfffeI'll try hard, and that's definite!
I seek!\xf000븁\x0000To solve!\xf000븁\x0000All the world's mysteries!\xf000븁\x0000And thus! I fight on!\xf000븁\x0000
Win or lose!\xfffeThe mysteries only grow!
I do not think it possible!\xfffeTo solve all mysteries on one's own!\xf000븁\x0000Irregardless! Something of value\xfffeto someone can still be found!
Fantastic Trainer sighted!\xfffeInspection imminent!\xf000븁\x0000
Inspection results:\xfffeSUPERB!
It makes me excited\xfffeto consider solving the secrets\xf000븀\x0000of Pokémon and Trainer!
I love this place for the\xfffeexcitement of lightning's flash!\xf000븁\x0000
ZZZZZAP!\xfffeI had a flash of insight!
When you move your body,\xfffeit happens through electric signals!\xf000븁\x0000When you have a flash of insight,\xfffea lightbulb goes off in your head!
Pokémon and balls are a heavenly match!\xfffeHelp us push our training\xf000븀\x0000all the way to eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Curses! Come on, not yet!\xfffeI shoulda been gutsy enough!
Me and my Pokémon\xfffestill don't got enough training...\xf000븀\x0000Maybe grind out five more levels...
Strength is achieved by a\xfffebalanced team of Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000Allow me to lecture you!\xf000븁\x0000
...I've been lectured!\xfffeWhat an incredible Trainer!
I've never tried playing soccer\xfffeas a team with my Pokémon before...\xf000븀\x0000Thanks for the amusement!
Dad works in the gym!\xfffeI'm training hard here!!\xf000븁\x0000
...Dad...\xfffe...I couldn't win!
I've fought Pokémon with dad,\xfffebut that was a pretty good battle!
The old workers\xfffetransport Pokémon and cargo!\xf000븁\x0000In my comfy shorts,\xfffeI'll join forces with my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Hmm! You seem to be\xfffeeven better friends with Pokémon!
The Pokémon around the containers\xfffecame on ships from foreign countries...\xf000븁\x0000Or so I like to pretend!
The taaaaall grass is waaaaay filled\xfffewith nuttin' but strong Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Hot dang!\xfffeWhat a Trainer!!
Fightin' with Pokémon in the tall grass\xfffemakes ya more 'n' more awesome!
Oh!\xf000븁\x0000Ohhh?\xf000븁\x0000Huh! It's not a Pokémon,\xfffeit's just a plain old Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
It's not a plain old Trainer,\xfffeit's a REALLY STRONG Trainer!!
Have you heard that when tall grass\xfffeshakes, a rare-ish Pokémon will come out?
These are my best Pokémon!\xfffeFreshly caught!\xf000븁\x0000
I just caught them...\xfffeI didn't train them yet!
Alright! I'll catch more\xfffePokémon in Yaguruma Forest\xf000븀\x0000and get more allies!
HIYAAAA! That's a good enough yell!\xfffeLet's get started already!!\xf000븁\x0000
PCHOOOOOOOO!\xfffeThat's my spirit deflating!
I'll tell you something, strong one!\xf000븁\x0000Rocks only need to be\xfffesmashed once per day!
I should have been elegant,\xfffebut I feel like I've slipped and tumbled!
I've seen many Trainers!\xf000븁\x0000The air I feel from tough Trainers...\xfffeI feel from you as well!\xf000븁\x0000
Truly!\xfffeJust as felt!
Of course I feel your strength,\xfffealong with overflowing kindness...
Could you be my most\xfffepowerful opponent in the vicinity?\xf000븁\x0000
Your talent and your sense...\xfffeThey're both dazzling!
I wonder, could the secret of\xfffeyour strength be your devotion?
I am a waiter skilled\xfffein Pokémon battling!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you, dear customer,\xfffefor the magnificent battle!
Our specialty\xfffeis Pokémon battles!
Welcome!\xf000븁\x0000Would you like a Pokémon battle\xfffewith your drink?!\xf000븁\x0000
A fantastic battle, dear customer!\xfffeWhat a sight!
Soda Pop! The thirst-quencher for\xfffeany Pokémon exhausted from battle!\xf000븀\x0000Buy it at a vending machine near you!
Mt. Helix changes with the seasons...\xfffeI change with my battles!\xf000븁\x0000
...Would it hurt to go easy\xfffeon your elders?!
I personally like winter best.\xf000븁\x0000The snow piled up on Mt. Helix...\xfffemakes for breathtaking scenery.
My Pokémon's favorite foods are\xfffemountain ore and Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
I give up!\xfffeAnd so do my Pokémon!!
When Pokémon eat mountain ore,\xfffeit also furthers digging work!\xf000븁\x0000How about that! Everything works out\xfffefor people and Pokémon!
I am the second-strongest\xfffemaster of Mt. Helix!\xf000븁\x0000
Henceforth, you shall be\xfffeMt. Helix's second-strongest...
I shall live on as the third-strongest\xfffemaster of Mt. Helix!\xf000븁\x0000By the way, the strongest\xfffeis Mr. Yacon, of course!
Got a problem, cannon's the solution!\xf000븁\x0000It's superb for understanding\xfffehow flying Pokémon feel!\xf000븁\x0000Now for a Pokémon battle\xfffeto understand how it feels to lose!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm blasting off!!
Thinking about your Pokémon\xfffewhen you fight makes you stronger!\xf000븀\x0000It puts you a step closer to victory!
Trainer! You've been shot around\xfffetoo much to fight well, I bet?!\xf000븁\x0000
Man, you're so composed!\xfffeSeriously unflappable!
A cannon used once\xfffemay be used again!\xf000븀\x0000That's the power of recycling!
I'm making careful preparations\xfffeto fly ever higher!\xf000븁\x0000
No problem! Even if I lose,\xfffeI'll just get myself ready and fly again!
Trainer! Remember what\xfffeyou were told at the start?\xf000븁\x0000"You can step into the cannons from\xfffeany side - top, bottom, right, or left!"\xf000븁\x0000How was that?\xfffeGreat impression, right?!
Checks are all clear!\xfffeChances of loss are at zero!!\xf000븁\x0000
No way! I DID run a check\xfffeon fighting style, right?!
Check once, then check again!\xf000븁\x0000Fooling yourself into thinking\xfffeeverything's fine only leads to disaster!
Castelia Gym slowly unfolds!\xf000븁\x0000Just like a beautiful art piece,\xfffeor a breathtaking battle!!\xf000븁\x0000
A beautiful fight...\xfffe...But is it art?
Press two switches, light two\xfffelamps, open a gate!\xf000븀\x0000This too is art!
I love the feeling of\xfffepassing through the honey walls...\xf000븀\x0000I've done it countless times!\xf000븁\x0000
Inexplicable...\xfffeIt's like passing through honey!
The honey walls...\xfffeWhat are they really made of?\xf000븁\x0000Don't you find it suspicious\xfffethat Mr. Arty refuses to tell?
How about it? This gym...\xfffeIt has a certain je ne sais quoi...\xf000븀\x0000A mysterious kind of charm, yes?\xf000븁\x0000
You, too, have\xfffemuch charm as a Trainer!
Personally, I think...\xfffethis gym is one of Mr. Arty's visions\xf000븀\x0000made into reality...\xf000븀\x0000And I can't get enough of it!
One who hides in the floor\xfffeshould not have to lose!
I've been defeated by\xfffeyour peerlessly tough will!
Hooo there, challenger!\xfffeHere comes the ooooold maaaaan!\xf000븁\x0000
Wait, did the old man\xfffejust lose a match?!
Head down, down, down!\xf000븁\x0000Go as far as you can go!\xfffeThat's the Trainer spirit!
When the lifts rise, so does your spirit!\xfffeWhen the lifts lower, it lowers...\xf000븁\x0000Beat me if you wanna know\xfffewhy Mr. Yacon's at the very bottom!\xf000븁\x0000
Losing made my\xfffeheart sink, too...!
Mr. Yacon awaits challengers\xfffeat the very bottom...\xf000븁\x0000So he'll never forget that long ago,\xfffehe was down in the pits himself!
Face up to your Pokémon and\xfffelay your feelings bare to each other!\xf000븁\x0000That's a good way to pass time\xfffein a Pokémon gym!\xf000븁\x0000
I'll be honest! Me and my Pokémon\xfffeare overflowing with regret right now!
Losing makes me apologetic\xfffeto my riled-up Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000But it's an important feeling to have\xfffefor getting stronger next time!
Whoa! Super strong!\xfffeToo bad I lost, but I'm inspired!
I'll just make the excuse that\xfffeI lost because the ship was swaying!
Temp Message\xfffeLet's battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Temp Message\xfffeI lost?!
Temp Message\xfffeI lost!
Temp Message\xfffeLet's battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Temp Message\xfffeI lost?!
Temp Message\xfffeI lost!
I was just hoping to stave off boredom,\xfffebut...! I played with fire and got burned!
Just as I was thinking you were just\xfffea cute kid, the battle's already over!
Your Pokémon are a rarity!\xfffeTake it from me!
I... I feel no searing regret!\xfffeFor I am elegant!
Di...\xfffeDizzzzzy...
I've noticed from my travels...\xf000븁\x0000Through our Pokémon,\xfffewe exchange our thoughts!\xf000븁\x0000
Yes, I do believe I've\xfffereceived a message from you!
I've noticed from my travels...\xf000븁\x0000A journey is a metamorphosis!\xfffeAnd you can't fear change!
Countless thoughts\xffferemain in the ruins!\xf000븁\x0000It's fun to guess what they are!\xfffeSo! How about yours?\xf000븁\x0000
My thoughts...?\xfffeIt REALLY sucks when I don't win!!
People and Pokémon vary,\xfffeand their thoughts change likewise.\xf000븁\x0000And in their own ways, I'm sure\xfffeevery single one of them is right!
You look like you're having fun!\xfffeCertainly it must be your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Yes! Our Pokémon have\xfffepleased us all with their energy!
When I'm lonely at night,\xfffeI lie down with my Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000and look up at the stars.\xf000븀\x0000I watch the trails of stardust\xf000븀\x0000and feel the rhythm of life...
Whether I'm traveling or not,\xfffeI want to make findings!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah! I've found numerous\xfffegood qualities about you!
The world is filled with marvels!\xf000븁\x0000So I look more,\xfffeso I listen more,\xf000븀\x0000and I think more and more...\xf000븀\x0000so I can find new things!
My Pokémon are special!\xfffeI'm gonna show you now!\xf000븁\x0000
I haven't quite mastered\xfffethe Mummy ability yet...
When your ability is changed to Mummy,\xfffeyou can't use the old ability.\xf000븀\x0000Kinda creepy, isn't it?
Hah! In the blink of an eye!\xf000븁\x0000We send out our Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Hah!\xfffeThe end already?!
Hah! In the blink of an eye,\xfffeI notice the superb nature of Pokémon!
I am a psychic,\xfffeso at a glance, I know...\xf000븀\x0000that you are a Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
I am a psychic,\xfffeso I know this battle is over.
Piled sand...\xfffePiling thoughts...\xf000븁\x0000If only you had telepathy\xfffeto know my thoughts precisely...\xf000븁\x0000Ah! No! Shut up, me!\xfffeI said something bizarre again!
A match, if you please!\xf000븁\x0000
Like, whoa...\xfffePerhaps my best challenger yet?
Flip the right switches, and\xfffeproceed from the right places.\xf000븁\x0000Take the right path, and\xfffeyou'll someday reach the goal!
The eternal problem\xfffeis not can or cannot...\xf000븀\x0000It's do or do not!\xf000븁\x0000
If you do not, you won't lose...\xfffeBut neither will you get strong!
Even if you lack the confidence,\xfffego for it with all your might!\xf000븁\x0000It'll work out! Because you\xfffehave your Pokémon with you!!
Slippery slidey icy floor!\xf000븁\x0000Perfect for improving\xfffeyour sense of balance!\xf000븁\x0000
I loooost!\xfffeI slipped when I should've slid!!
Hachiku is always slipping,\xfffeso the ice is missing in spots.\xf000븀\x0000The holes seem to form a route\xf000븀\x0000across the ice...  or is that just me?
Well then! While the gym's tricks\xfffeare making you dizzy,\xf000븀\x0000I'll stand in your way!!\xf000븁\x0000
Eek!
Shooting out of cannons,\xfffetwirling around on ice...\xf000븀\x0000and getting the badge is rough too!
I always calm my heart\xfffeand serenely examine my battles.\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa?! WHAT?!\xfffeYou lie?! You're telling the truth?!
Being calm and lacking emotion\xfffeare very different.\xf000븁\x0000Master Hachiku is calmly joyful\xfffeand calmly angered...
KING OF KARATE!\xf000븁\x0000Face off with Pokémon who have\xfffebeen shown the ways of my moves!\xf000븁\x0000
I am the Karate King!\xfffeI am the master, but I lose often...
I come from a fighting dojo\xfffein the Kanto region!\xf000븀\x0000I'm going worldwide, so to speak!
Oh! Trainer!\xfffeHow about some training?\xf000븁\x0000
Training complete!
It's fine to go slow.\xf000븁\x0000Work hard day after day,\xfffeand you will someday be tough!
Are you looking for Pokémon here?\xfffeOr just on a stroll?\xf000븀\x0000Well, let's battle anyway!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow, you're...\xfffeI dunno, really awesome, I guess!
Forget this battle if you will,\xfffebecause I'll make sure I never do!
My area of expertise is\xfffespeed-eating competitions!\xf000븁\x0000
My area of inadequacy\xfffeis Pokémon, actually...
I train here to\xfffeconquer my inadequacies!
Just like a good book,\xfffethe introduction to a battle is key!
...And now begins my last chapter.
The epilogue of our\xfffestory draws nearer...
...Ah, I can't believe you've\xfffedone this! Incredulity is me!\xf000븁\x0000Even with all the words I know,\xfffeI simply can't express myself.\xf000븁\x0000To put it into words\xfffewould shackle my pure feelings...\xf000븀\x0000But allow me to say this...\xf000븁\x0000You are great!!
Such a move, at such a time...?\xfffeOh, I'm simply charmed!
Now then... However the battle goes,\xfffeI shall not back down.
Even at this rate, I know...\xfffeThere is still a way to win!
Whenever anyone wins,\xfffeanother must lose.\xf000븁\x0000That is the essence of a battle.\xf000븁\x0000A good battler does not boast of his\xfffevictory nor fall to distractions,\xf000븀\x0000but simply seeks the next victory.
...Such strength!\xfffeYou're making my heart leap!
My last Pokémon!\xfffePut all your strength into this!
...Might this be the end?\xfffeI'll put my all into the next attack!
There's no ultimate Pokémon.\xfffeNo best combination ever was...\xf000븁\x0000That's why continuous\xfffevictory is so difficult.\xf000븁\x0000But a heart that seeks strength wants to\xfffeknow what it is to be the strongest...\xf000븀\x0000I feel that is precious.\xf000븁\x0000And I respect you,\xfffefor you possess it.
This is looking to be a wonderful time...\xfffeI'm getting a bit excited, actually.
Even now, I won't be confused,\xfffeand I won't clamor...
I shall not give up, for my Pokémon\xfffefight with their belief placed in me.
You're a most elegant and\xfffeexcellent Trainer, you are.\xf000븁\x0000Your Pokémon carry such dignity\xfffethat it was a joy to face them.
Do you believe we come to mutual\xfffeunderstanding through Pokémon battles?
I overflow with a love for my friends\xfffefrom my ancestors! Let me show you!
My friends are wounded...\xfffeThis is what a Pokémon battle does!
Feh!\xfffeAs always, as always...
It's no fun to see\xfffemy friends cornered...
Very well...\xfffeI understand it is my defeat.
...You think you\xfffecan stop us with that?!
My final friend...\xfffeLend me your courage!
Do you mean the world has\xfffechosen not me, but you?!
With this... my truth...\xfffePokémon's dreams... they have crumbled...
Ha!\xfffeI have made ample preparation for THAT!
...Grumble...\xfffeWhat could this mean?!
My scheme! My perfect scheme\xfffeto dominate the world!!
I'm a doctor!\xf000븁\x0000Of course, I'll look at\xfffeany Pokémon that need healing!\xf000븁\x0000So! Show your\xfffePokémon to me!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength is boundless!\xfffe...I'm rather moved.
Even though your Pokémon\xfffeseem relatively healthy,\xf000븀\x0000I'll heal them for you!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm looking to be\xfffethe world's best doctor!\xf000븁\x0000But I'm planning on being\xfffethe world's best Trainer first!
An ace like me has\xfffetoo much pride to lose!\xf000븁\x0000
It's so shameful when\xfffeyou can't protect your pride!
Pride doesn't come from just\xfffethinking you're high and mighty!\xf000븁\x0000You must pride yourself\xfffeon years of effort!
I've been pondering\xfffehow I should fortify my Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000And I've finally found an answer!\xf000븁\x0000
Was I unable to fully\xffferead your desires...?
Read into what\xfffeyour foe wants to do!\xf000븁\x0000But a human opponent may often\xfffechange in that regard, so watch out!
Before you go to the Pokémon League,\xfffelet me test your skill!\xf000븁\x0000
It seems so obvious, but I see there\xfffeis something higher than the top...
The Elite Four awaits challengers\xfffeto the Pokémon League...\xf000븀\x0000What kind of people might they be?
I'm beat...\xf000븁\x0000Um, but my Pokémon\xfffeare really proud of me,\xf000븀\x0000so let's get started!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh nooo!\xfffeI couldn't show off to you...
When looking for an opponent,\xfffeyou gotta think "I want to win!"\xf000븁\x0000So I want to be someone\xfffewho can think "I want to win!"
When I'm lost,\xfffeI meet a Trainer!\xf000븀\x0000Now let's trade blows!\xf000븁\x0000
Mrmmm... I can't fight\xfffevery well when I'm lost...
People go as far as they can,\xfffeget lost, and stop...\xf000븁\x0000But if a Pokémon can walk ahead,\xfffeit gives you courage!
Those who pass through here\xfffehave a variety of expressions!\xf000븁\x0000It amuses me to see them...\xfffeand moreso to BATTLE THEM!\xf000븁\x0000
Mwahahaaa!!\xfffeHow AMUSING!!
Winning is good,\xfffebut winning isn't everything...\xf000븀\x0000Don't lose sight of what's important!
Hold on!\xfffeYou there, young Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000Take a look at my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Not bad!\xfffeI quite like your strength!
At Pokémon are trained,\xfffethey grow closer to their Trainers.\xf000븀\x0000Their relationship grows stronger!
If there's a cave to the east,\xfffeI'll go and train my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000If there's a Trainer to the west,\xfffeI'll go and challenge them!\xf000븁\x0000
Your training ways\xfffeoverwhelm me!!
Pokémon training Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000Living in the harsh wild,\xfffeit's of course a possibility.
Ahhh! Are you the legendary\xfffePokémon that lives here?!\xf000븁\x0000
You frightened me!\xfffeYou're just a person, though...
According to what I've heard,\xfffethe legendary Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000trained a Pokémon as a pupil!
As the sun rises into the world,\xfffeso do the Pokémon I've trained!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa!\xfffeYou're pretty good!
For Pokémon and us, every day\xfffehas been filled with happiness!\xf000븀\x0000Here's to further joy!
When you're happy,\xfffethe Pokémon by you delight...\xf000븁\x0000What Pokémon are they?\xfffeShow me!\xf000븁\x0000
My land!\xfffeWhat a sight!
In happy and sad times,\xfffePokémon are beside us...\xf000븁\x0000Let us pray that we can be\xfffetogether as long as is possible!
The Tower of Heaven...\xfffeis a tower that rises to heaven!\xf000븁\x0000...Anyway, let me\xfffefight your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Truly heavenly!
I nearly felt like\xfffeI was gonna be laid to rest here!
Pokémon trained in Unova\xfffeand Pokémon who grew up elsewhere...\xf000븀\x0000Both rest in peace here.\xf000븁\x0000
You swell with\xfffethe energy of life!
Pokémon trained in Unova\xfffeand Pokémon who grew up elsewhere...\xf000븀\x0000All were beloved...
Now I shall expose you\xfffefor your true colors...\xf000븁\x0000You are...\xf000븁\x0000A Pokémon Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
How can this be?!\xfffeI knew your true colors!
Understanding your foe\xfffeis something anyone can do...
The dragon gym leader of Souryuu awaits\xfffeTrainers who forge their own path!\xf000븁\x0000
Perhaps you could\xfffeforge a path in this gym!
A gym leader is, quite literally,\xfffethe one in the gym who's on top!\xf000븁\x0000So Souryuu's gym leader\xfffeis at the highest point!\xf000븁\x0000If you want to meet them, climb up\xfffethe dragon's back to the top floor!
Have you figured out\xfffehow the dragon's neck moves?\xf000븁\x0000
You're strong! Is the dragon's\xfffeneck all you want to know about?!
The dragon's arms\xffferaise and lower...\xf000븁\x0000In accordance to them,\xfffethe neck moves right or left...\xf000븀\x0000and up or down!\xf000븁\x0000Got it?! Now here's a hint!\xf000븁\x0000If both arms are down,\xfffeso too will the dragon's neck go!
HOW! MUCH!\xfffeDO YOU KNOW YOUR POKéMON?!\xf000븁\x0000
You're showing as much of the\xfffepower of your Pokémon you can!
As a Trainer, I have no need\xfffeto become stronger.\xf000븁\x0000It's enough if my Pokémon are\xfffestrong enough to support me.
Could you perhaps\xfffebe at a loss on what to do?\xf000븁\x0000
I don't think so!\xfffeYou seem very self-confident!
The dragon in this gym\xfffecan also be an elevator!
I teach any Trainers who surpass me\xfffehow to proceed in the gym!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa!\xfffeYou've surpassed me!
Jump down off the\xfffetriangular marks!\xf000븁\x0000Press the switch below,\xfffeand the dragon's neck moves,\xf000븀\x0000allowing you to proceed onward!
Are you happy simply being with Pokémon?\xfffeOr must you grow strong to be pleased?\xf000븀\x0000Let me see what type you are!\xf000븁\x0000
...Well, your Pokémon certainly\xfffeseem happy to be with you!
People love Pokémon\xfffein many different ways...\xf000븁\x0000I grow strong with them...\xfffeThat's how I choose to love them.
What kinda stuff\xfffedo you do, Trainer?!\xf000븁\x0000
You're...\xfffepretty awesome, huh?!?
I love Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000It just excites me to think\xfffeabout what my opponent does!\xf000븁\x0000Win or lose, I enjoy it,\xfffeso it's all the same in the end!
My favorite word is CHALLENGE!\xfffeDo you like CHALLENGE?\xf000븁\x0000
I would say\xfffeyou like CHALLENGE!
Why do I like CHALLENGE...?\xf000븁\x0000When you make a CHALLENGE,\xfffeyou can find something good...\xf000븁\x0000And if you don't, you're just\xfffemaking excuses for why you're not!
Oof...\xfffeI'm deeply hurt!!
We've been battling\xfffefor over ten years now!\xf000븁\x0000Let us show you\xfffethe ways of veterans!\xf000븁\x0000
The time you've spent\xfffeisn't everything!
Getting strong...\xf000븁\x0000No matter how much you fight,\xfffeit's like walking an unending road...\xf000븁\x0000That is the meaning of\xfffethe back of this gym's dragon...
I've heard about you! You're the one\xfffewho overworks their Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I'd heard you were strong, too...\xfffeSo I guess I should've expected this!
...If you're trying to fall down,\xfffestand in the center of the quicksand.\xf000븁\x0000NO, I'm NOT being nice!\xfffeIt's so the others can beat you!
You! You should lose\xfffefor the sake of your Pokémon!!\xf000븁\x0000
What a Trainer you are...
My Pokémon LOST\xfffeall thanks to you!\xf000븀\x0000Don't you think that's TRAGIC?!\xf000븁\x0000...Besides, that strength of yours\xfffejust comes from relying on Pokémon, hmph!
If everyone just releases their Pokémon,\xfffethey won't have to fight!\xf000븁\x0000
If neither of us had Pokémon,\xfffeI wouldn't be losing like this!
What are you doing getting in our way\xfffewhen you don't know jack about our ideal?!
I fight for the young king...\xfffeAnd that is all!\xf000븁\x0000
My liege...\xfffeI can make no excuse.
Nothing is changeless.\xfffeUnova too shall be reborn.\xf000븀\x0000Why can't you SEE that?
The changing of the world\xfffewill be accompanied by pain!\xf000븁\x0000
Ow-ow-ow...\xfffeBut I don't like pain!
But if no one will change the world,\xfffewe must do our best to try!\xf000븁\x0000Yes! Can't you understand\xfffehow Lord N feels?!
Foolish Trainers shall NOT reign\xfffeover Pokémon and their glory!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow!\xfffeYou are just the WORST!
So am I a foolish Trainer\xfffefor losing to you?!\xf000븁\x0000Come on! I was trying so hard\xfffein this sand, why couldn't you LOSE?!
Those who think unlike us\xfffeshall not be forgiven!\xf000븁\x0000
Urgh...\xfffeI won't let you stand!
I repeat! Those who think unlike us\xfffeshall not be forgiven!\xf000븁\x0000...One of your stupid friends\xfffeis waiting below!
When I'm surrounded with rocks,\xfffeI start to get really tense!!\xf000븁\x0000
When I lose,\xfffethe tension snaps...
I consider my fluctuation of tension\xfffeto be one of my finer points!
Why do I dig?\xfffeWhy do you fight?\xf000븀\x0000Why not battle and find out?\xf000븁\x0000
All your experiences thus far...\xfffeSo they are the source of your strength!
Fighting makes you stronger,\xfffedigging opens up holes...\xf000븀\x0000If you have a goal, just get to it!
When I work,\xfffeI give it my all! That's me!\xf000븀\x0000And it's how my Pokémon live!\xf000븁\x0000
Is this the result\xfffeof giving it my all?!
Well, back to work, then?\xf000븁\x0000My cute little Pokémon\xfffeare proudest of our work...
My favorite dishes are...\xfffeMountains! Rice! Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000And a fun battle!!\xf000븁\x0000
Bwahahaha!\xfffeYou got me!!
Your Pokémon were tough!\xf000븁\x0000But my Pokémon were\xfffepretty impressive too, eh?!
Looking for dreams? Wander here...\xfffeLooking for victory? Fight!\xf000븁\x0000
I guess I wasn't\xfffeable to dream...!
I'm looking for a legendary Pokémon\xfffesaid to lurk in this cave.\xf000븁\x0000Wahaha! Yep, I'm a romantic no matter\xfffehow many years I put on!
Electricity runs in the rocks\xfffescattered around this cave!\xf000븀\x0000It amps up my batteries!\xf000븁\x0000
ELECTRICAL!!
My beloved Pokémon are\xfffethe source of my energy!\xf000븀\x0000This has been scientifically proven!
Let me do SCIENCE with your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
What can SCIENCE do\xfffefor the taste of defeat...?
Anyway, you should do SCIENCE too!
I wish to detail the mechanics\xfffeof the secrets to your strength.\xf000븁\x0000
...I was too fixated on your mechanics\xfffeto be especially attentive there.
The mechanics of rainfall\xfffeand the structure of seasons...\xf000븀\x0000Nature never ceases to amaze!
I see! So you would\xfffechoose that move...
You've come far,\xfffebut it's not over yet!
...!\xfffeStrong as ever!
I see! So you would\xfffechoose that move...
You've come far,\xfffebut it's not over yet!

I see! So you would\xfffechoose that move...
You've come far,\xfffebut it's not over yet!
...!\xfffeStrong as ever!
PLASMAAAAA!\xfffe...AAAAA!
Long live the Plasma!
You're such a figurative thorn in our\xfffemagnificent plan's metaphorical side!
So what did you think?!\xfffe...I'm such a sore loser.
PLASMAAAAA!\xfffeT-The dreams...!
PLASMAAAAA!\xfffeThis is a nightmare!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Losin' to a runt?\xfffeNow that's a shocker!
The best way of using what you\xfffelearn is applying it practically!\xf000븁\x0000
I know I have to lose sometimes!\xfffeBut I think I really GET it now!
Developing your knowledge like this\xfffeis like making it three-dimensional!
What the?! But you're just a kid!!\xfffeYou little HOOCHEE!!!
You and us are clearly\xfffeplaying by different rules!
PLASMAAAAA! Alas,\xfffethe Pokémon couldn't be saved!
Perhaps you're only in my way\xfffe'cause you're jealous of my fashion?
I know full well the value\xfffeof getting the first strike!
If I show the full power of my Pokémon,\xfffeI can still turn this around!
...Well done.\xfffeBut why can't I win?!
I know full well the value\xfffeof getting the first strike!
If I show the full power of my Pokémon,\xfffeI can still turn this around!
...Well done.\xfffeBut why can't I win?!
I know full well the value\xfffeof getting the first strike!
If I show the full power of my Pokémon,\xfffeI can still turn this around!
...Well done.\xfffeBut why can't I win?!
Umm, at times like this,\xfffeone should Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I see... Was that\xfffeyour favorite Pokémon there?
Pokémon battles can\xfffehappen anywhere in the world!\xf000븁\x0000Just ask someone their favorite\xfffePokémon and you'll get along!
I live life\xfffeDYNAMICALLY!\xf000븁\x0000
Even when I lose,\xfffeI'm DYNAMIC!
Pokémon are always with me!\xfffeThat makes me so DYNAMIC!

... ...What?
Huh, it's over already?\xfffeI lost in the blink of an eye...
Heehee...\xfffeYou're strong...
Hahhh, hahhh, hahhh, hahhh...
Temp Message

Temp Message
The beauty of living things\xfffeworking with all their might!\xf000븁\x0000Ahhh!\xfffeLet me see it closer!\xf000븁\x0000
Yes, I've seen it clearly!
Ah... living things giving it their all\xfffewill always be too beautiful!
Beat me, and I'll give you\xfffesomethin' good from my backpack!\xf000븁\x0000
Nice!\xfffeYou're strong!
Okay, take this.\xfffeAs promised!\xf000븁\x0000
Running around mountains and forests\xfffewith resolve is a great feeling!
I CAME HERE ON MY JOURNEY\xfffeBUT THIS PLACE IS VERY BUSY\xf000븁\x0000
IS THERE A FESTIVAL\xfffeGOING ON HERE
I FOUND THIS ON MY JOURNEY\xfffeI DON'T NEED IT YOU TAKE IT\xf000븁\x0000
EVERYONE HAS SIMILAR FASHION HERE\xfffeIS THIS SOME KIND OF CEREMONY
There's no satisfying\xfffean athlete!\xf000븁\x0000That's what I've gathered\xfffefrom watching a few games.\xf000븁\x0000Why do I say that?\xfffeBeat me and I'll tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
Are you satisfied by your victory?\xfffeOr do you just accept it?
This Moomoo Milk is delicious!\xfffeThat's true satisfaction!\xf000븁\x0000
However well they play,\xfffethey'll always want to play better!\xf000븁\x0000I'm not quite satisfied\xfffewith my bread-baking, either...\xf000븁\x0000So I'll try to make the\xfffenext batch even tastier!
Things get heated here!\xfffeI came 'cause I heard that!\xf000븀\x0000Will you heat things up?!\xf000븁\x0000
My burning feelings\xfffeare scorching me up!
My heart is on FIRE!\xfffeThanks for the blazing battle!\xf000븁\x0000Now to get worked up\xfffewatching some sports!
I've raised my Pokémon healthily,\xfffeand been stimulated by the games...\xf000븀\x0000Now! To put it into battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Losing is painful!\xfffeThat's important to remember!
I know more about losing\xfffethan about winning!\xf000븀\x0000And I'm the same way with sports...
My trained Pokémon are too good\xfffeto be beaten, not even by the pros!\xf000븁\x0000
Your trained Pokémon\xfffeare just as amazing!
Seems there sure are\xfffea lot of ways to train Pokémon...
There's no time to waste!\xf000븁\x0000
When it comes to this,\xfffeit's fine as long as I worked hard!
Even finding time to catch\xfffeyour breath is part of the job!
I got my ticket and came,\xfffebut are they not playing any games?!\xf000븁\x0000
Things are busy at work!\xfffeWhat am I DOING here?!
Athletes get their off days just like\xfffeold men like me get vacation!
Some of the kids at the daycare\xfffeI work at might be stars someday!\xf000븀\x0000Any good kids here?\xf000븁\x0000
You're shining, I suppose,\xfffebut I want a real star!
You've got star material!\xfffeMy regards for the future!\xf000븁\x0000
Should I start getting signatures now\xfffefrom kids who'll probably be stars?
I love soccer and\xfffePokémon the best!\xf000븁\x0000So? Having said that,\xfffeof course my Pokémon are good!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon's attacks...\xfffeThey were just too much!
I used to be a soccer player,\xfffeand my position was sweeper!\xf000븁\x0000I'm a sweeper in a way\xfffeat my current job, too...
The players' Pokémon are the best!\xf000븁\x0000But my Pokémon\xfffeare totally awesome too!\xf000븁\x0000
And your Pokémon\xfffeare even AWESOMER!
Your Pokémon gotta try hard too!\xfffeThat how I train mine!
Did you see today's game?!\xf000븁\x0000The players and the Pokémon\xfffewere handing off balls to each other!\xf000븁\x0000I've gotta let out\xfffemy excitement in a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, but man,\xfffeI'm still so pumped!
The only place to see\xfffePokémon enjoying sports\xf000븀\x0000is Raimon City!
Just coming here makes you tense!\xfffeSo I'mma battle you!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost to you so QUICK!
Watching the games\xfffegets me riled up!\xf000븀\x0000I can't even sit still!
"Doctor!\xfffeIs there a doctor on board?"\xf000븁\x0000"Yes, I'm a doctor."\xfffe"Then quickly, begin the battle!"\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! My Pokémon\xfffelost their fighting fitness!
When your Pokémon faint,\xfffeget them a Revive!\xf000븀\x0000You should have one!\xf000븁\x0000
Even when I'm watching the game,\xfffeI wonder, "what if a player gets injured?"\xf000븀\x0000I always worry about these things...
Of all the people in the crowd,\xfffeyou talked to me!\xf000븀\x0000You've got a discerning eye!\xf000븁\x0000
What a response!
My favorite part is how\xfffedecisively you use moves!\xf000븁\x0000Take this... if you want!\xf000븁\x0000
Heh heh!\xf000븁\x0000Even though I'm in a crowd,\xfffemy strength has been exposed...
I'm typically an ace of sorts, but here,\xfffeI just wanna be an ordinary girl!\xf000븁\x0000
I don't really want to think\xfffeabout Pokémon right now, okay?!
Sorry, but can I just\xfffequietly give you this?\xf000븁\x0000
Being an ace, sometimes\xfffeI just want to be a regular girl!\xf000븁\x0000I want to have fun screaming\xfffemy head off for the stylish players!
Which team will\xfffescore a goal next?!\xf000븀\x0000Beat me and I'll tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
FWEEEEET!\xfffeThe next goal will go to... THAT TEAM!
My psychic powers let me\xfffedirect the ball into the goal!\xf000븀\x0000But only just before it goes in...
Ohoho...\xf000븁\x0000My precious team\xfffealways wins!\xf000븁\x0000
Huh...?\xfffeMy streak... it couldn't have been...
You must put feeling into your cheers!\xfffeIf you believe, they'll ring victoriously!
Fishing is a fine sport!\xfffeWhy isn't there a Fishing Stadium?!\xf000븁\x0000
...Well, fishing among nature\xfffeis kinda part of the fun.\xf000븁\x0000
I like the quiet of nature,\xfffebut I like this kind of bustle too!
Many sports originated from\xfffethe games of gentlemen!\xf000븁\x0000
LADIEEEEES AND GENTLEMEEEEEN!\xfffeThe game is concluded!
A gentleman always\xfffegives a parting gift!\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon battles are a game born\xfffefrom the friendship of man and Pokémon!
Hey, didya see?!\xf000븁\x0000Daaang, man! There's so many\xfffefamous faces from TV here!\xf000븁\x0000
The players are all so rad!\xfffeThey're like my heroes, man!
Maaan, why didn't I bring\xfffea camera or something to get signed...?
What delights guests is the same\xfffein both sports and juggling!\xf000븀\x0000See the results of my practice!\xf000븁\x0000
I can juggle ten of these balls\xfffewhile I'm Pokémon battling!
I have the technique,\xfffebut I dunno how to use it!\xf000븀\x0000It must be put into practice!
I can hear screaming fans\xfffecheering from that flashy dome...\xf000븁\x0000Man...\xfffeI'm SO jealous!\xf000븁\x0000
What's so good about athletes?\xfffeWhat's so bad about karate?
I hear nothing but "ha!"s and "hoo!"s\xfffecoming from the dilapidated dojo...\xf000븀\x0000Maybe I should just\xf000븀\x0000become an athlete, then...
When I grow up,\xfffeI'm gonna be a pro player!\xf000븁\x0000
Waaah!\xfffeI haven't given you my signychure!
When I'm a pro, I'll hafta\xfffepractice my signychure!
My daddy's a player here!\xf000븁\x0000
Wheeeeeh...\xfffeDaddyyy!
...Sniff... nah, I won't cry...\xfffeI promised daddy I wouldn't cry...
As a lady, I enjoy sports!\xfffeIn a most refined manner, of course!\xf000븁\x0000Pokémon battles are\xfffesports too, in a way!\xf000븀\x0000Let us elegantly delight in one!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!\xfffeIt's called falling with grace...
I mistakenly ordered one of these\xfffeinstead of a ball, so you may have it.\xf000븁\x0000
Sports and Pokémon battles\xfffeare to be firstmost enjoyed!\xf000븁\x0000Fuss too much over victory and loss,\xfffeand you come to miss the point!
I'm gonna get good at Pokémon battles\xfffeand marry a professional player!\xf000븁\x0000
Ahhh!\xfffeHave I so far to go?!
Your Pokémon are strong!\xfffeI've got to give strong people good things!\xf000븁\x0000
Strong people are charming,\xfffeand unconditionally so!
Hikers, sportsmen,\xfffeand Pokémon Trainers!\xf000븀\x0000Do you know what's important?\xf000븁\x0000
Mooogh!\xfffeYou certainly understand!
It's being absolutely prepared!\xfffeCan't do a thing without preparation!
I'm a star!\xfffeWhy isn't anyone noticing... ah!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost! Don't look at me!
Did you come for somebody's signature?\xfffeBut not mine, huh...?
You look energetic!\xf000븁\x0000I PUNISH those\xfffewho aren't energetic!\xf000븁\x0000
You've got lots of stamina!\xfffeYou're a bottle of energy!
Alright, energetic Trainer!\xfffeTake this with you!\xf000븁\x0000
Nursing is a battle of stamina, too!\xfffeMorning, noon, and night!
My darlin' works here!\xfffeSo? You jealous?\xf000븁\x0000
My darlin' isn't actually\xfffean athlete, per se...
My darlin's a janitor!\xfffeHe sweeps up all the mounds\xf000븀\x0000on his own every day.\xf000븀\x0000Classy, eh? Bet YOU can't do that!
Sports in the rain\xfffeseem like such a pain!\xf000븁\x0000What about a Pokémon battle\xfffein the rain, though?\xf000븁\x0000
Well, it's indoors,\xfffeso it doesn't rain in here...
The stadium has roofs\xfffeso there can be games anytime!
Hey! It's me! It's me!\xfffeIt's Unova's top pilot!\xf000븁\x0000
You! You've got guts!\xfffeBe my apprentice!
You ever flown in your life?!\xfffeFly, fly, fly your heart out!
Wanna know what\xfffethe VIP seats are like?\xf000븁\x0000Beat me and I'll\xfffetell you about them!\xf000븁\x0000
The VIP seats...\xfffeare really far from the players!
You can see the game well,\xfffebut the players look like ants!
You...!\xfffeYou must be a fan of HIM!\xf000븁\x0000I understand! But...\xfffeI'll never hand him over!\xf000븁\x0000
Oyoyoyo...\xfffeI'm so sorry, for his sake...
I thought over it a lot, and\xfffeI realized the size of the crowd\xf000븀\x0000brings him all the more joy!\xf000븁\x0000You! Give him your cheers!\xfffeScream until your arms fall off!
When I watch a game,\xfffeI want to get my body moving!\xf000븁\x0000
I worked up a good sweat!
The dome is nice, but...\xf000븁\x0000I'd really like to play\xfffesome sports in the great outdoors!
Once you see these guys at work,\xfffeyou'll wanna join the Rangers too!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! Astonishing!\xfffeYou are GREAT!
You should be a Ranger too!\xfffeWork hard and get tough!
Between my studies, I watch sports!\xfffeAnd between games, I Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Huuurk...!\xfffeThat wasn't a break at all...!
Going out to play occasionally\xfffemakes studying go more easily!
Okay, it's settled!\xfffeIf I can beat you...\xf000븀\x0000I'll be a gym leader!\xf000븁\x0000
Hmm... I suppose my future as\xfffea gym leader is hazy at best?
What does the future hold?\xfffeYou have to think in the long run!
Being good at sports,\xfffeand being a strong battler...\xf000븀\x0000HMM, are they related?\xf000븁\x0000
I'll use this as data...!
Hm, yes, you are\xfffevery interesting indeed!\xf000븁\x0000You may take this!\xf000븁\x0000
To me, both sports and Pokémon\xfffeare matters of science!
Being holed up in a lab\xfffereeking of medicine\xf000븀\x0000certainly stresses one out...\xf000븁\x0000
WORRRGH! Oh, the PAIN!
Whoa, it feels great to scream!\xfffeTake this as thanks...\xf000븁\x0000
I should use Pokémon\xfffebattles as a stress-reliever!
These are not, in fact,\xfffecomfy shorts which I wear!\xf000븀\x0000No, they're HALF PANTS!\xf000븁\x0000
Yah! You're so strong,\xfffeyou nearly blew my shorts off!
You are INTENSE!\xfffeTake this present!\xf000븁\x0000
I think soccer players and\xfffebasketball players are both great!\xf000븁\x0000So I wear shor... I mean,\xfffeI wear half pants!\xf000븁\x0000But I must admit, baseball and\xfffefootball players' getups are pretty sweet!
HMMM...!\xf000븁\x0000You give off the very same\xfffescent as a sports player!\xf000븁\x0000
I see... So it's merely\xfffethe scent of the strong...
You seem stronger still...\xfffeVery well, take this.\xf000븁\x0000
I implore you to use that\xfffeto become yet stronger!
Ah, you have quite\xfffea few League badges there!\xf000븁\x0000Well, let me evaluate your skill!\xf000븁\x0000
Your fighting style reminds me\xfffeof my own from long ago!
One such as you must\xfffesurely have use for this!\xf000븁\x0000
Let us be Trainers,\xfffeno matter our age!
Cheering during the games\xfffehas made me parched!\xf000븁\x0000If I beat you, mister,\xfffeyou're buying me a drink!\xf000븁\x0000
Augh, battling only\xfffemade my throat drier!
Alright, mister,\xfffeI'll give you somethin' good!\xf000븁\x0000
Make sure you drink lots\xfffeof water in places like this!
Cheering during the games\xfffehas made me parched!\xf000븁\x0000If I beat you, miss,\xfffeyou're buying me a drink!\xf000븁\x0000
Augh, battling only\xfffemade my throat drier!
Alright, miss,\xfffeI'll give you somethin' good!\xf000븁\x0000
Make sure you drink lots\xfffeof water in places like this!
Let us battle on\xfffethe field I prepared!\xf000븁\x0000
The ultimate battle\xfffeon the ultimate field!
Alright! Gotta prepare the field\xfffebetter and better!
This stuffy heat...\xfffeIt reminds me of the good old days...\xf000븁\x0000
My old wounds ache anew...
Whether I look like it or not,\xfffeI used to play sports once...
So YOU'RE the culprit!!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, no you're not...\xfffeSorry! Apologies!
I came running because I heard\xfffesomeone was stealing points here...
Huh? Battle, like, HERE?\xfffeHel-LOOO?! Everybody's WATCHING!\xf000븁\x0000
Gosh, you're rowdy! Going around\xfffepicking fights wherever you like...
Well, even if you're sorta rowdy...\xfffeI think I like it... teehee...
Er, there's something\xfffeI want you to tell me!\xf000븁\x0000
Well... you certainly told me!
I'm supposed to start work at\xfffethe Battle Subway today... and, uh...\xf000븀\x0000Do you know where it is?
When I grow up, I wanna be\xfffea pro player's racquet!\xf000븁\x0000
Hiro: Your strength has me\xfffetrapped in a love game...\xf000븁\x0000Shin: There's no way I can win...\xfffeIt's a love game...
Pro battler, when I grow up,\xfffeI want to be your bicycle...
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeWell, then I can't fight you!
When I grow up, I wanna be\xfffea pro player's basketball!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength has me\xfffetrapped in a love game...
Pro battler, when I grow up,\xfffeI want to be your Goods Case...
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeI prefer to play doubles...
SHWOO! PHOOSH!\xf000븁\x0000Yeah, that's right!\xfffeThat's how I fight!\xf000븁\x0000
Hiro: SHWOOOOO...\xfffePlunk...\xf000븁\x0000Shin; FAULT!\xfffeI messed up my serve!!
Jumping around for such\xfffelong periods of time...\xf000븁\x0000Tennis players are\xfffejust so amazing!
Shwoo, phoosh!
HAAA!\xf000븁\x0000See that?\xfffeThat's my killer serve!\xf000븁\x0000But my Pokémon battles\xfffeare even better than that!\xf000븁\x0000
FAULT!\xfffeI messed up my serve!!
He who controls the serve\xfffecontrols the match!\xf000븀\x0000Gotta practice my serve more!
HAAA!
Watching pros excites me so!\xf000븁\x0000HEY!\xfffeWhich means I won't lose!\xf000븁\x0000
Ai: Huh?\xfffeSo I lost...?\xf000븁\x0000Sora: Ouch... Okay, so seeing and\xfffedoing are sorta different!
Watching the pros fills me\xfffewith awe and confidence!
Oh man, oh man!
I'd love to move so beautifully!\xfffeWe should get together sometime!\xf000븁\x0000
Ouch... Okay, so seeing and\xfffedoing are sorta different!
The awe comes from seeing\xfffethe pros making it look easy...
Th-thump! Th-Thump!
Whoa!\xf000븁\x0000The players are watching!\xfffePerfect! Let's battle now!\xf000븁\x0000
Taku: Gyaaah!\xfffeI looked so stupid there!\xf000븁\x0000Yasu: Poké-Poké-Pokémans! If you\xfffecan't do it, no one... can...?
I thought they were looking here,\xfffebut nope, just the other team...
Is that player watching me?\xfffeNah, probably not...
If I win this Pokémon battle,\xfffeyou gotta cheer for our team!\xf000븁\x0000
Poké-Poké-Pokémans! If you\xfffecan't do it, no one... can...?
I lost, so I'll cheer for you!\xf000븁\x0000Whoo! Whoo! Whoo for you!\xfffeGo far! Go far! Whoever you are!
Hmm, I don't think our team\xfffeis getting enough cheering...
When you're all tensed up...!\xfffePokémon will support you!\xf000븁\x0000Lemme show you how magnificent\xfffethat is through Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Taku: The majesty of basketball...\xfffeI thought I would be telling you...\xf000븁\x0000Yasu: I'm feeling as deflated\xfffeas an old basketball...
The key to basketball\xfffeis coordinated teamwork!
Hmph! Hmph!\xf000븁\x0000A top-notch athlete\xfffespeaks with their back!
With all the players wanting it,\xfffeit becomes a real scramble.\xf000븀\x0000Wish I could be that ball...\xf000븁\x0000
I'm feeling as deflated\xfffeas an old basketball...
The ball sees the players and thinks,\xfffe"hey, guys, don't fight over me!"\xf000븀\x0000...Or so I imagine.
With all the players wanting it,\xfffeit becomes a real scramble.\xf000븀\x0000Wish I could be that ball...
Why do I love basketball?\xfffeBeat me and I'll tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
Miku: Oh, what! Geeeeez!\xf000븁\x0000Sae: Look! I lost, but lo and behold,\xfffethe ball's still spinning!

Taka: You guys sure are\xfffeholding the fort strong!\xf000븁\x0000Shige: You've crossed far\xfffebeyond the goal line...
Football is heated because players\xfffehave intense solidarity between them!
Whoa! Our solidarity isn't\xfffquite THAT good yet!
My encouragement will echo\xfffeendlessly beyond the goal line!\xf000븁\x0000
You've crossed far\xfffebeyond the goal line...

Football is a team sport!\xfffeGet yourself two Pokémon!
Double Battle!\xf000븁\x0000There's no better way to\xfffefeel the heat of football!\xf000븁\x0000
Your epic beatdown\xfffetotally stupefied me!
Formations change\xfffewith the flow of battle...\xf000븀\x0000Oh, and in Pokémon battles, too!
Double Battle!\xf000븁\x0000You need two Pokémon to\xfffefeel the heat of football!
Thum-thump! Ah! Thum-thump! Ah!\xfffeHear the beat of the crowd!\xf000븁\x0000
Tatsu: It's the beat of our souls!\xfffeThanks for watching!\xf000븁\x0000Masa: It's the shout of our souls!\xfffeThanks for watching!
Ah! Yes! Clap! Clap-pap-WHOO!!\xfffeNow we'll go to that beat!

Pah-pah-pah! Ah! Pah-pah-pah! Ah!\xfffeAre we gonna hit our limit soon?
Ole, ole, ole!\xfffeThat's my cheer song!\xf000븁\x0000When my Pokémon hear it,\xfffethey do better than ever!\xf000븁\x0000
Mana: Ole, ole, ol... eh?\xfffeMan, it's over!\xf000븁\x0000Sae: You're real strong!
"Ole" means, like, "go!"\xfffeOr "fight!" Or something!
Ole, ole, ole!\xfffeHey, I'm cheering, here!\xf000븁\x0000Come with two Pokémon\xfffeand sure, I'll fight you!
The friends that came with...\xfffeThat's what the cheering fans are!\xf000븀\x0000We sing 'cause we want to!\xf000븁\x0000
You're real strong!
I'm a fan of any player\xfffethat does their best!\xf000븀\x0000So I want EVERYBODY to win!
It'd be a little tough to\xfffefight with one Pokémon...
Hey there! You know\xfffewhat "off-sides" are?\xf000븁\x0000
Mana: That was off-sides!\xfffeTOTALLY off-sides!\xf000븁\x0000Sae: Y... You JERK!\xfffeI'm not telling you anymore!
Huh? What are off-sides?\xfffeA... Ask the other girl, she knows!
OFF!
Hey there! You want I tell you\xfffewhat "off-sides" are?"\xf000븁\x0000
Y... You JERK!\xfffeI'm not telling you anymore!

SIDES!
Bottom of the ninth,\xfffetwo outs, bases loaded...\xf000븀\x0000Is the game... already decided?\xf000븁\x0000
Katsu: Steeeee-RIKE!!\xfffeGame set! Okay bye!\xf000븁\x0000Go: Ahhh!\xfffeMy Poké Baaaalls!
A home run to turn everything around...\xfffeThat's what I always hope for!
Stee... RIKE!
I don't have any home run balls,\xfffebut I have these Poké Balls!\xf000븁\x0000
Ahhh!\xfffeMy Poké Baaaalls!
I wish I could catch\xfffea home run ball just once...!
BALL!
Knock it outta the park!\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: Knocked it outta the park!\xf000븁\x0000Yuki: Knock it!
Miss Camille is pretty good at\xfffeknocking people outta the park...
One on two?\xfffeThose're some hard knocks!
Hey, why do they call it "knocking" it\xfffeout of the park, anyway?\xf000븁\x0000
Knock it!
From what I've heard, it's simply\xfffebecause "knock" carries more of a...\xf000븀\x0000hard-hitting feeling, I guess!
We fight together!\xfffeSo you need two Pokémon!
Hey! YOU!\xf000븁\x0000Stop leering lustfully\xfffeat my fave player!\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: Oh, great, I can't believe\xfffeYOU made me lose...\xf000븁\x0000Yuki: You need to try harder!\xfffeStop tripping me up!
Other than liking the same team,\xfffewe couldn't be more different...\xf000븀\x0000Well, as long as our core values\xf000븀\x0000are the same, I guess!
Ah, geez, now YOU'VE\xfffegot me in a pickle...
Oh, shut up!\xf000븁\x0000Whoever I cheer for\xfffeis gonna win!\xf000븁\x0000
You need to try harder!\xfffeStop tripping me up!
We can't work together one bit\xfffeexcept when we're cheering!\xf000븀\x0000But that usually doesn't matter,\xf000븀\x0000so I don't really care!
Ugh, I lost? Seriously?\xfffe'Cause you weren't even trying...
I'm pretty strong!\xfffeI'mma keep bein' that today!\xf000븁\x0000
O-Oops...
Your strength!\xfffeIt is also pretty good!
POWER!!\xf000븁\x0000When you have power\xfffethat no one can match,\xf000븀\x0000you win Pokémon AND football!!\xf000븁\x0000
T... This must mean\xfffeI don't have enough power...!
Nnngh... I've got to put in\xfffemore training somehow...!
Pokémon and balls\xfffewere made for each other!\xf000븀\x0000Take on my soccer-trained Pokémon!
Dang! That really didn't work?!\xfffeBut they're too gutsy to lose!
Me and my Pokémon\xfffestill need more practice...\xf000븀\x0000In terms of levels, maybe ten...?
I can't lose now!\xfffeI'mma keep doin' that today!!\xf000븁\x0000
W-Whoops!
Once! Twice! Three strikes, I'm out,\xfffe'cause you're waaay tooo strooong!
POWER!!!\xf000븁\x0000My roaring muscles\xfffecan conquer EVERYTHING!\xf000븁\x0000
This must mean I don't\xfffehave enough muscle...!
I may have to change\xfffethe way I train somehow...
Pokémon and balls\xfffewere made for each other!\xf000븀\x0000Take on my soccer-trained Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Dang! That really didn't work?!\xfffeBut they're nothing if not gutsy!
Me and my Pokémon\xfffestill need more practice...\xf000븀\x0000In terms of levels, maybe twenty...?
My strength is maximum!\xfffeI'MMA KEEP BEIN' MAXIMUM!!\xf000븁\x0000
D... DANG!
Your strength!\xfffeIt is basically a home run factory!
POWER!!!!\xf000븁\x0000My power can tear open any path,\xfffeespecially the path to victory!\xf000븁\x0000
Maybe... power alone\xfffewon't get you anywhere...?!
In football and Pokémon,\xfffeyou need power AND technique!
Pokémon and balls\xfffewere made for each other!\xf000븀\x0000Take on my soccer-trained Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Dang! That really didn't work?!\xfffeBut they're INFINITELY gutsy!
Me and my Pokémon\xfffestill need more practice...\xf000븀\x0000In terms of levels, maybe fifty...?
Put in practice after practice,\xfffeand become an amazing player...\xf000븀\x0000It's me! That's who it applies to!\xf000븀\x0000Alright! Play ball!\xf000븁\x0000
Game SET!
Okay, practice time!\xf000븁\x0000Practicing repeatedly to get\xfffebetter every time is the best!\xf000븁\x0000That's how you can become\xfffean even more amazing player!
KIDS! Meet mah POKéMON!\xfffeThey're trainin', so be nice, GOT IT?!\xf000븁\x0000
My blockin' steelin' Pokémon\xfffeshoulda GUARDLIED ya...
I'm offa my long break nah, an'\xfffeI'm ALREADY gettin' back to trainin'!
I know the power of a team\xfffebuilt of powerful Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000Allow me to lecture you!\xf000븁\x0000
...I've been lectured!\xfffeYou are truly great!
Powerful Pokémon...\xfffeThey're the crux of any elite.\xf000븀\x0000Teams have pros and cons too...
Me and my Pokémon's pitching\xfffeis the best in the world!!\xf000븁\x0000
What?! You caught my fastball?!\xfffeAre you even human?!
My pitches come so fast, it's impressive\xfffeif you can even hit them!\xf000븁\x0000Mostly it's only Pokémon\xfffewho can catch them...
I-I'm not fat...\xfffeAm I?\xf000븁\x0000
Mgheee!
Mgheh! What are you doing?!\xfffeI said I'm not fat!
Usage of the ball is all on you!\xfffeWatch my Poké Ball throws!\xf000븁\x0000
Even after the ball's thrown,\xfffeit's still part of my practice...
Usage of Pokémon is something\xfffeelse I could stand to practice...
I play from time to time, but\xfffeI want to be a better player!\xf000븁\x0000That's why I keep fighting\xfffeconstant Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
Gyaaagh!\xfffeMessed up my pass!
I'll do anything to get better!\xfffeUntil I'm finally satisfied with myself!
An elegant tennis player\xfffebattles just as fancifully!\xf000븁\x0000
A-And if defeated, does not\xfffelet herself become flustered.
I am a lady...\xfffeS-So I shall not be downhearted.
I'm a starting player now, but\xfffeI want to be a better player!\xf000븁\x0000That's why I keep fighting\xfffeconstant Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
Gyaaagh!\xfffeWrong positioning!
When I think about why I'm\xfffemaking mistakes, I make less.\xf000븁\x0000In the end, I'm left with all my\xfffegood points, so I'm a better player!
Just how elegant and ladylike\xfffecan one possibly be...? Behold!\xf000븁\x0000
Waaaaah! What...!
I... I AM a lady, but...\xfffeI am quite disoriented now...
I'm doing great in every game, but\xfffeI want to be the BEST player!\xf000븁\x0000That's why I keep fighting\xfffeconstant Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
Gyaaagh! Missed my shot!\xfffeIt never ends!!
I'll never give up!\xfffeI have no limits!\xf000븁\x0000No one will tell me\xfffeI can't get any better!
As a lady, I shall commence with\xfffethe most elegant battle ever known!\xf000븁\x0000
C...\xfffeCould you PLEASE go easier on me?!?
I... I am a lady... s-so...\xfffesniff... sob...\xf000븀\x0000I will own up to my loss...
No matter how much I sweat,\xfffeI never smell all that bad!\xf000븁\x0000
A refreshing sweat...\xfffeAh, it's good to be an athlete!
Make sure to take\xfffea bath after a battle!\xf000븁\x0000Just like you brush your\xfffeteeth after every meal!
The world tournament is soon!\xfffeYou're just a wall to me...\xf000븀\x0000Time for SMASHING practice!\xf000븁\x0000
Hahhh! Hah, hah, hah...\xfffeThat was some good training...
You and I just met,\xfffeand we're already at love game!
Hey, Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000I'm taller than you, so you better\xfffewatch out for my attacks!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, right...\xfffeWe fight with Pokémon...
We always like to play basketball here...\xfffeand let the Pokémon in, too!
My toughest serve approaches\xfffe55 miles per hour...\xf000븀\x0000Apologies in advance!\xf000븁\x0000
Those attacks...\xfffeTruly intense!
I train my Pokémon by having them\xfffecatch my toughest serve!
My Pokémon\xfffewere sooooo cute!
Pokémon listen to me\xfffeand fight for me!
You... you were brought\xfffehere by someone's manipulation!\xf000븁\x0000Beat me and I'll\xfffetell you their secret!\xf000븁\x0000
Pheh!\xfffeCan't believe I lost...
Lord Getis is one of the Seven Sages\xfffein support of our king.\xf000븁\x0000And Lord Getis has\xfffethree of his own underlings...\xf000븀\x0000The Dark Trinity!
If I win, I'm gonna\xffferelease your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
PLASMAAA!\xfffeRegret... ful!
...Why? Your Pokémon look\xfffeso happy beside you...
The Pokémon living in Thunderstone Cave\xfffeare so beautiful...\xf000븀\x0000We need to free them from people!\xf000븁\x0000
NOOO! I mean,\xfffePLASMAAA!
When regular Trainers\xfffeuse Pokémon, it's bad!\xf000븁\x0000When we of Team Plasma\xfffeuse Pokémon, it's good!
I, one of the proud Team Plasma,\xfffeam your opponent!\xf000븁\x0000
I, one of the proud Team Plasma...\xfffeam, er...
What are you fighting for?\xfffeActually... what are you living for?
Show me your strength,\xfffePokémon-abusing Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
...I see...\xfffeYou sure can, uh, abuse Pokémon!
When people use Pokémon, it becomes\xfffea competition, strong versus weak...\xf000븀\x0000Is that acceptable?\xf000븀\x0000Are Pokémon Trainers' tools?
These are Team Plasma's wishes!\xf000븁\x0000And you have\xfffeno part in them!\xf000븁\x0000
Wait! What! You're!\xfffeToo! Strong! Hrnnngh!
These are Team Plasma's wishes!\xf000븁\x0000Our king will stand above all\xfffeand release all Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000And you! Let your Pokémon run!\xfffeStop being a Trainer!
I've reached peak tension\xfffehere at Dragon-Helix Tower!\xf000븀\x0000Hurry up and lose to me!\xf000븁\x0000
Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh!\xfffeIt's going down now!
...I gotta say, though, what a tower!\xf000븁\x0000With so much history to it, I can't\xfffehelp but feel a sublime power!
Hachiku, Cheren, who cares....\xfffeThey're just annoyances to me!\xf000븁\x0000
I don't get it...\xfffeI don't get ANY of you...
Why do you and the\xfffegym leaders defy us?\xf000븀\x0000It's like you don't even understand!
I'm sooo strong!\xfffeI'm gonna beat everybody!\xf000븀\x0000That's what you came in thinking, huh?\xf000븁\x0000
Hm...\xfffeOkay, so it went like you thought!
Once the king of Team Plasma\xfffeorders the world into union...\xf000븁\x0000Trainers will vanish,\xfffeand so will all strife!
We exist for\xfffethe sake of Lord N!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah!\xfffeLord N...!
Since there is night,\xfffethe sun is beautiful.\xf000븁\x0000Since there is us,\xfffeour king must shine...!
Unova's new dawn\xfffeis growing distant...
Stooop! Er, but like I said,\xfffeyou won't stop US!
What?!\xfffeYou're still fighting fit!
Even if I lost, I'll say it anyway!\xfffePLAS-MA! PLAS-MA!
That's all you got? Ha, I'll be fine!\xfffe...Totally. Maybe. I think.
Uhhh, this is looking...\xfffepretty bad for me, actually...!
...Whew! I'm beat.\xfffeI mean, beaten...
That's all you got? Ha, I'll be fine!\xfffe...Totally. Maybe. I think.
Uhhh, this is looking...\xfffepretty bad for me, actually...!

Uhhh, this is looking...\xfffepretty bad for me, actually...!
...Whew! I'm beat.\xfffeI mean, beaten...
Ohhh!\xfffeYou chose THAT move!
This always happens when\xfffeI know my Pokémon are watching...
...Regardless of my Pokémon,\xfffeI've TOTALLY done my best!!
Ohhh!\xfffeYou chose THAT move!

Ohhh!\xfffeYou chose THAT move!

Attacks that'll always hit,\xfffeattacks that can hit first...\xf000븀\x0000There's all kinds!\xf000븁\x0000
Considering what your Pokémon\xfffeshould hold is crucial...
...So I see!\xf000븁\x0000Losing to you must mean\xfffethat I still lack experience.

G... Giving it my all!\xfffeMe AND my Pokémon!
Alrighty then!\xfffeThis one's up next!
Wait wait wait...\xfffeAm I in trouble here?!
Whoaaa...\xfffeI couldn't win...
G... Giving it my all!\xfffeMe AND my Pokémon!

Hey, hey, Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000Lemme show you\xfffethe Pokémon I have!\xf000븁\x0000
Did you see my Pokémon?\xfffeIt's so sturdy, it's awesome!
Pokémon with the ability Sturdy\xfffecan't be fainted in a single blow!
Hey, hey, Trainer!\xfffeWhat Pokémon do you have?\xf000븀\x0000I wanna seeeee!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa! AWESOME!\xfffeI didn't know you could train like that!
Evolving Pokémon makes\xfffethem strong, right?\xf000븁\x0000But if you don't evolve them,\xfffethey learn moves sooner!
I can't see ahead\xfffeof me in the sandstorm!\xf000븁\x0000I can't see you,\xfffeso I'll battle you instead!\xf000븁\x0000
SAAAANDSTOOOORM!
This parasol wasn't designed\xfffefor protection from sandstorms...\xf000븁\x0000Waaah! Curse you, Route 4!\xfffeMy tears won't stop...
A duel on a bridge!\xfffeNow that's just cool!\xf000븁\x0000
It doesn't look so good to lose, though...\xfffeBut yeah, you definitely looked cool!
It's sorta nice to sway back and forward\xfffeup on these thin bridges!
I LOVE me summa\xfffethese bridge things!\xf000븁\x0000It takes balance!\xfffeIt takes careful steps!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, but\xfffeI cannot be stopped!
By walking on the bridges,\xfffeyou can avoid wild Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000But stop moving for too long,\xfffeand you'll fall right off!
Pokémon lived among nature\xfffefrom the very beginning!\xf000븁\x0000So training Pokémon outdoors\xfffelike this is of course best!\xf000븁\x0000
We'll go at it again!\xfffeWe have plenty of time!
Even the seemingly-complex Mt. Helix\xfffeis a straight path in essence!\xf000븁\x0000Don't be in such a rush!\xfffeThat helps in achieving any goal!
Being with Pokémon is common,\xfffeand so too are Pokémon battles...\xf000븀\x0000Want to see if that's really true?\xf000븁\x0000
Being with Pokémon makes us\xfffehappy, so we battle!
If Pokémon were opposed to battle,\xfffeI would stop being a Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000Because there's so much more\xfffethat can be done with Pokémon!
Oh! My new-era-ushering\xffferesearch...!
Get yourself three Pokémon\xfffethat are ready to fight!\xf000븁\x0000Rotation Battles are a new kind of\xfffebattle using three Pokémon!
Well... that didn't work!
I've spun out!
Rotation Battles\xfffeare such a thrill!!
Rotation Battles are Pokémon battles\xfffewith three Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000Get three Pokémon ready!
I'm one lucky guy today!
You need spunk to spin\xfffefrom here to there!
Hmph! I just wasn't\xfffevery lucky today, is all...
Triple Battles are a new kind of\xfffethree-Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000Go get three Pokémon, please!
Alright! Lemme show you\xfffehow things typically go!
That... wasn't how\xfffethings typically go...
I've got to train\xfffemy Pokémon more!
Go and prepare three Pokémon\xfffefor a Triple Battle!
Alright, everybody!\xfffeLet's do our best together!
Your Pokémon were clearly\xfffethe ones who did their best!
It takes a lot of thought,\xfffebut it's fun to do!\xf000븀\x0000A Triple Battle, I mean!
I choose a move,\xfffeand my Pokémon uses it...\xf000븁\x0000And that move is then\xfffedelivered to YOUR Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I was beaten, but during the battle,\xfffeI really connected with you guys...
Perhaps this berry will further\xfffeconnect you with your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
From today to tomorrow...\xfffePeople, Pokémon, and the world...\xf000븁\x0000I love such feelings\xfffeof connection...
I'm not running at the moment,\xfffebut I always dash through nature\xf000븀\x0000with all my might!\xf000븁\x0000
I was hoping to win so I'd reach the\xfffegoal without running, but... nope!
I'm not running any more...\xfffeHere's a present!\xf000븁\x0000
Run, run, I'm on the run!\xfffeIn the town, up the trail!\xf000븁\x0000Running lets your whole body\xfffefeel everything around you!
All I'm doing is watching\xfffethe drifting end of my hook...\xf000븁\x0000And I meet you!\xfffeLet's send out our Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
As a lover of fishing and Pokémon,\xfffemy life has double the enjoyment!
All I'm doing is watching\xfffethe drifting end of my hook...\xf000븁\x0000Yes, in life, even the\xfffemeaningless has meaning!
Owow... How is it\xfffeyou're so strong?
Yays! Hooray! Awesome!\xfffeBig bro's so strooong!!
Oho! Boy, boy!\xfffeYour Pokémon are ripped!
Oww... so uncool...
Of course, I'm the strongest and\xfffemost amazing in the end... uh?
Your strength...\xfffeversus my strength, hm...
Is strength a matter of not being beaten?\xfffeOr is it all about winning?
...Pokémon battles are fun,\xfffebut what is strength?!
Your strength...\xfffeversus my strength, hm...

Your strength...\xfffeversus my strength, hm...
Is strength a matter of not being beaten?\xfffeOr is it all about winning?
...Pokémon battles are fun,\xfffebut what is strength?!
Rotation Battles are Pokémon battles\xfffewith three Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000Get three Pokémon ready!
Rotate at the cost of a turn...\xfffeThat's a Rotation Battle!\xf000븀\x0000Can you handle it?\xf000븁\x0000
My eyes are spinning!\xfffeAnd so's my head...
There's an element of turnabout, but\xfffea strong Trainer that can cope\xf000븀\x0000will excel in Rotation Battles!
Triple Battles are a new kind of\xfffethree-Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000Go get three Pokémon, please!
Think and think again on\xfffehow to combine three Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000It can be incredibly destructive!\xf000븁\x0000
Were my positions wrong?\xfffeOr are there more problems than that?
Which Pokémon\xfffegoes in the center...?\xf000븀\x0000I'm still thinking about it!
My...!\xfffeMy special Emonga...?!
Fishermen watch the flow of the water!\xfffeI'll try watching the flow of battle!\xf000븁\x0000
The flow of battle...\xfffeIt's too much! I can't keep track!
The current on Waterway 17\xfffeis intense!\xf000븁\x0000If you can't ride it like a pro,\xfffeyou won't get anywhere!
My specialties are... breaststroke!\xfffeForward crawl, butterfly...\xf000븀\x0000And of course, Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost at one of\xfffemy specialities?
Work on my swimming?\xfffeOr train my Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000Hmm... I can't seem to decide,\xfffeso I just swim with my Pokémon!
A Pokémon rides the waves,\xfffeand you ride the Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000Does that mean you're dual-riding?\xf000븁\x0000
A big wave's passed now...\xfffeNow my heart can calm down...
Trainer! Ride the\xffferaging waves of life!\xf000븁\x0000...That seemed good in my head,\xfffebut it sounded so lame...
By swimming with my Pokémon,\xfffeI've learned EVERYTHING that's great\xf000븀\x0000about my Mamanbou!\xf000븀\x0000I'll show you its strength!\xf000븁\x0000
What a sprayful Trainer!\xfffeI mean, playful! You're oh-so-lively!
If I'm wearing a bikini...\xfffewhere do I put my Poké Balls?\xf000븀\x0000Teehee... woman's secret!
I was taking a short break,\xfffebut a Pokémon battle? Different story!\xf000븀\x0000BA-BAM! Let's enjoy this!\xf000븁\x0000
BA-BAM!\xfffeDA-DANG!!
I'll tell you why I was\xfffetaking a break...\xf000븁\x0000It's sorta problematic\xfffeif your bikini gets swept away...
Did you get here by looking\xfffeat the Town Map, too?\xf000븁\x0000Maps are great!\xfffeThey tell you so much!\xf000븁\x0000
I wish I had some kind of\xffferoadmap to battling...
Where do I go next...?\xfffeLet the Town Map decide!
In seeking a variety of Pokémon,\xfffeI've come all the way here...!\xf000븁\x0000So, show me what kinds of\xfffePokémon you've come with!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon...\xfffeI get a really good vibe from them!!
There are Pokémon Trainers\xfffeacross the sea...\xf000븁\x0000What kind of Pokémon and\xfffeTrainers might be out there...?
Battling is about rhythm!\xf000븁\x0000Whose Pokémon can fight\xfffeto the rhythm?\xf000븁\x0000
It's your Pokémon!\xfffeYour Pokémon move SO rhythmically!
The world doesn't move to\xfffethe beat of just one drum!\xf000븁\x0000There's your rhythm,\xfffePokémon's rhythms,\xf000븀\x0000and nature's rhythm...
It feels so great looking down\xfffeon everything from on high!\xf000븁\x0000Pokémon battles are the same way!\xfffeLet's fight as I look down on you!\xf000븁\x0000
You're amazing!\xfffeI ended up looking up instead!
However hard it may get,\xfffethe higher you climb a mountain,\xf000븀\x0000the closer the sky becomes!
Atop a slightly-elevated hill...\xfffeYou and I will face off...\xf000븁\x0000
Atop a slightly-elevated hill...\xfffeI have no losing remark to make...
Atop a slightly-elevated hill...\xfffeWhat am I looking at...?\xf000븁\x0000I'm looking at the numerous\xfffeTrainers I've faced before...\xf000븁\x0000How many more will I fight...?\xfffeI will treasure all my battles.
Going to Yaguruma Forest?\xfffeOr going to smash rocks?\xf000븁\x0000Either way, you must be tough, else\xfffeyou'll get stopped in your tracks!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, no more...!\xfffeYou're very tough!
Tough Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000Let me heal your\xfffePokémon for you!\xf000븁\x0000
In and around Yaguruma Forest\xfffeare many Pokémon with moves\xf000븀\x0000that cause effects like poison.\xf000븁\x0000You need anything, come to me!
Even badder!
Vrrrrroom!!
Hrmmm...?!\xfffeYOU'RE here?\xf000븁\x0000
Your power exceeds\xfffemy psychic ability!
The Musharna that appears here\xfffeFriday every week\xf000븀\x0000is said to be somehow unique.
This is a spot of power!\xf000븁\x0000Let the power within\xfffeawaken in us both!\xf000븁\x0000
Was I standing\xfffein the wrong spot?!
In reality, everyone has\xfffesome Dream Smoke!\xf000븁\x0000When you realize your dreams,\xfffeisn't that just like Dream Smoke?!
Yipe! I was trying to\xfffepredict your movement and run...!\xf000븁\x0000
Yipe! I was trying to\xfffepredict your thoughts, but I lost!
When your dreams seem unattainable,\xfffeyou try to run away...\xf000븁\x0000If you don't hold onto\xfffewhat's important, it'll leave you!
In studying Pokémon...\xfffethese wondrous creatures...\xf000븁\x0000Battling can also be\xfffea good method!\xf000븁\x0000
Why did I lose?\xfffeI can't help but wonder!
As much research is done and compiled,\xfffethere's always new Pokémon discoveries!
I've been working on\xfffemy research and skipping sleep...\xf000븀\x0000Are you a dream?\xf000븁\x0000
Logically improbable!\xfffeSurely this is a dream...?
Speaking of dreams,\xfffeMiss Makomo's Dream World studies!\xf000븀\x0000It's some amazing research!\xf000븀\x0000Have you tried Game Syncing?
If I'm to study dreams,\xfffeI simply must look into yours!\xf000븁\x0000
No! I can't see any dreams\xfffefrom the pits of defeat!
The Dream Smoke from\xfffethe Pokémon Musharna...\xf000븁\x0000Its secrets haven't been fully revealed,\xfffebut it's definitely amazingly powerful!
I want to scientifically explain the\xfffemysterious powers of psychics!\xf000븁\x0000
But I fought in such\xfffea logical manner!
Only about half of the world\xfffecan be explained through logic...\xf000븁\x0000The rest is feeling!\xfffeWhich is why it's so full of mystery...
Boku no kokoro ni boku-tachi no\xfffedeai wo kizamu tame ni\xf000븀\x0000anata to shoubu wo morau kudasai.\xf000븁\x0000
Sono shougeki...\xfffeZettai wasurenai!
Mita keshiki mo...\xfffeDeai shita hito mo...\xf000븀\x0000Waza wo tsukatta Pokémon mo...\xf000븁\x0000Kioku ni sorera wo kizamu.
Tu n'imagineras jamais le nombre de\xfffepays que j'ai visités, et le nombre\xf000븀\x0000de Dresseurs que j'ai combattus!\xf000븁\x0000
Wah! Encore un formidable\xfffesouvenir de voyage!
Quand j'aurai beaucoup, beaucoup\xfffevoyagé, je rentrerai à la maison,\xf000븁\x0000et je pourrai raconter tout\xfffeplein de choses à ma famille!
The power of the running waterfall...\xf000븁\x0000Let us feel that energy's\xfffemagnificence in our battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Our attacks\xfffecouldn't hold up!!
I recognize your strength!\xfffeI give you this!\xf000븁\x0000
I suppose I'll train my soul\xfffestanding under the waterfall!
As we spend time together,\xfffewe understand each other's hearts...\xf000븀\x0000I wonder, can you defeat us?\xf000븁\x0000
You, too, perfectly understand\xfffeeach other's hearts!
When you look at this berry,\xffferemember us!\xf000븁\x0000
My work as a Ranger is fun,\xfffebut I just love passing time\xf000븀\x0000with my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000Nothing will ever part us!
You there!\xfffeDo you raise your own Pokémon?\xf000븀\x0000Or leave them to the daycare?\xf000븁\x0000
I was only thinking\xfffeabout eggs...
Share this berry\xfffewith your precious Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
The daycare on Route 3!\xf000븁\x0000If you leave two Pokémon there...\xf000븁\x0000You might come back to find...\xfffeWhoa! An egg! How'd that happen!
Look at this beautiful plain,\xfffewide open for a healthy run...\xf000븀\x0000Now look at my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
But I was feeling so vigorous\xfffeuntil a while ago!
I'll share this berry\xfffewith your Pokémon as well!\xf000븁\x0000
I ran so vigorously,\xfffeit just wore me out...\xf000븀\x0000Don't you think that's cute?!
Sometimes, you're on a picnic!\xfffeSometimes, you battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Haru: Your Pokémon look like\xfffegreat friends to have!\xf000븁\x0000Chika: While I was thinking about what\xfffemy partner was doing, it was over...
I was just thinking...\xfffeWhen you have Pokémon in balls...\xf000븁\x0000You absolutely have to\xfffeshow them your feelings!
It's a picnic for two!\xfffeDon't you have two Pokémon?
With our perfect combination,\xfffewe'll sweep you off your feet!\xf000븁\x0000
While I was thinking about what\xfffemy partner was doing, it was over...
To fight a Double Battle well,\xfffeyou have to know the moves\xf000븀\x0000your partner's Pokémon will use!
We fight as a duo,\xfffeso you need two Pokémon!
I was looking into the\xfffePokémon around here, but...\xf000븀\x0000I'm interested in you, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Why...!\xfffeWhat deeply interesting Pokémon!
In Unova and in other regions,\xfffePokémon that look similar...\xf000븁\x0000They can have different\xfffenatures or appearances!
I was looking into the\xfffeterrain around here, but...\xf000븀\x0000I'm interested in you, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Why...!\xfffeWhat a deeply interesting Trainer!
The ruggedness of this terrain...\xfffeI estimate this undulation is a result\xf000븀\x0000of the flow of a river.
In art, I'm looking for two things:\xfffefeeling and logic!\xf000븁\x0000And a beautiful battle, too,\xfffewill have both feeling and logic!\xf000븁\x0000
Could I even see\xfffethat strength...?!
Artists can be classified\xfffeinto two types...\xf000븁\x0000Those who make the visible,\xfffeand those that make the invisible!
I'm a fantastic fisherman\xfffewho loves everything!\xf000븁\x0000As such a fisherman, I must\xfffefight with fantastic Pokémon!!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost!\xfffeI love you all!
I want to set out on the\xfffeRoyal Unova from Castelia City\xf000븀\x0000and try some sea fishing!
Don't get overwhelmed\xfffeby my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm too overwhelmed\xfffeto speak...!
Is it my rod?\xfffeOr is it my own fault?\xf000븀\x0000...Or is it having all the same Pokémon?
Hmm! I feel you are\xfffea capable Pokémon Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000If I battle you, perhaps I'll get\xfffethe gist of what you're like!\xf000븁\x0000
Hm! Strong ones are strong...\xfffeand weak ones are weak!
I guess the gist of fishermen is...\xfffe"Leisurely hurrying"?
You! Show me what kinds\xfffeof awesome Pokémon you use!\xf000븁\x0000
Hoho! Now those are\xfffesome first-class Pokémon!
Even when people use great Pokémon,\xfffeI'm not the least bit envious!\xf000븁\x0000Because in my eyes,\xfffemy Pokémon are the best for me!
Our Pokémon are\xfffea stellar combination!\xf000븁\x0000
Ena: I don't believe it!\xfffeHow are you so strong?\xf000븁\x0000Lina: Why?! For real, we used\xfffeour ultimate power!
When you're friends with Pokémon,\xfffepower just gushes forth!
Whaaa?! Only one Pokémon?\xfffeWell, I can't fight, then!
Our combination is the BEST!\xfffeWe won't lose, no sir!\xf000븁\x0000
LIEEES!\xfffeWhy'd that happen?!
The abilities Plus and Minus\xfffemake the ultimate combination!
Whaaa?! Only one Pokémon?\xfffeWell, I won't fight, then!
While I watch the beautiful scenery,\xfffemy heart flutters, I Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I was so fascinated by\xfffethe battle I had with you...
The peaceful sound of the waves\xfffeoverlaps upon itself...\xf000븁\x0000Like a first-class orchestra...\xfffeDon't you hear it too?
Walking on and on\xfffeacross a sandy beach...\xf000븁\x0000How is it?! Doesn't it\xfffejust feel wonderful?!\xf000븁\x0000
BEACHED!!
Walking on a sandy beach...\xf000븁\x0000Because I so love\xfffemy footsteps in the sand!
Oh?\xfffeA marvelous Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000Will you look at\xfffemy divine Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000
Woo!\xfffeSHOCKING!
...Thinking back on it,\xfffein all my good and bad times...\xf000븀\x0000Pokémon have always been with me.
Heeey there, traveling Trainer!\xfffeLooking for a good time?\xf000븁\x0000
Huh? Over already?!\xfffeNooooo! I wanted to play more Pokémon...
When Pokémon use their moves\xfffeand look me in the eye,\xf000븀\x0000my heart just starts racing!
A girl loitering on the beach,\xfffealone, carrying a parasol...\xf000븀\x0000Hey, will you fight me?\xf000븁\x0000
It can block ultraviolet rays,\xfffebut it can't block attacks...
I heard you needed a parasol\xfffefor the beach, but, uh...\xf000븀\x0000Am I the only one carrying one?
What?! Battle ME?\xfffeAlright, but are you STRONG?\xf000븁\x0000
Mghhhhh...\xfffeYour Pokémon definitely are!
I enjoy being with Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000That said!\xfffeI'll keep enjoying it still!\xf000븀\x0000We'll always be together!
If you fight until you win,\xfffeyou can never lose!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm writhing in agony! No!\xfffeI'm rolling in regret!
Practice makes\xfffeyour heart grow stronger!\xf000븁\x0000So I'm at least grateful\xfffefor the practice!
The reason Trainers and\xfffePokémon are together...\xf000븀\x0000Do you know what it is?\xf000븁\x0000
The sorrow of my loss\xfffeis split with my Pokémon...
Our joy is doubled,\xfffeand our sorrow is halved...\xf000븀\x0000That's why we're with Pokémon.
To be a fishing master,\xfffeyou need to perfectly bring together\xf000븀\x0000a number of different rhythms!\xf000븁\x0000
Um! I didn't get my\xfffetiming quite right there!
You! It's quite super that\xfffeyou have a Super Rod!\xf000븁\x0000Right! I'm sure you know,\xfffebut here's how to use it!\xf000븁\x0000First, face the water,\xfffeand use the Super Rod!\xf000븁\x0000Next, concentrate!\xf000븁\x0000When a Pokémon bites,\xfffea "!" will appear,\xf000븀\x0000so pull the Rod back fast!
On a bridge!\xfffeTrainers fighting!\xf000븀\x0000It's a picture-perfect moment!\xf000븁\x0000
I didn't lose because I was weak,\xfffeyou won because you're way too strong!
On a bridge!\xfffeTrainer walking into the sunset!\xf000븀\x0000This is even more picture-perfect!
Climbing many mountains,\xfffetoughening up their muscles...\xf000븀\x0000Those are my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! If you collected my tears,\xfffeI'd cry you a whole ocean!
The move Waterfall, yes, indeed,\xfffelets you climb waterfalls!\xf000븁\x0000...But what about "Mountain"?
So we'll have a match,\xfffebut don't be too harsh, okay?\xf000븁\x0000I can't relax if we're\xfffeputting in all our might!\xf000븁\x0000
You're a natural!\xfffeNot bad!
I was awkward because I was\xfffetrying to do things I couldn't...\xf000븁\x0000If you can do things reliably,\xfffethen you'll always be a natural!
Time for my world's-best Pokémon\xfffeto make their debut!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are cute too,\xfffebut my Pokémon are CHARMING!
Get it? My love for my Pokémon\xfffeis the best in the world!\xf000븀\x0000Nobody's gonna love them more!
Se ripenso a quante montagne\xfffeho attraversato in lungo e in largo,\xf000븀\x0000mi viene tanta voglia di una lotta.\xf000븁\x0000
Vengono in mente altre lotte in\xfffecui ho perso proprio come adesso!
La strada percorsa non si cambia!\xf000븁\x0000Ma su quella da percorrere\xfffepuò accadere ancora di tutto!
What's wrong, Pokémon Trainer?!\xf000븁\x0000Lost on your journey...\xfffeno, lost in life? Hm?\xf000븀\x0000Battle me so I can know!\xf000븁\x0000
You're not lost at all\xfffewhen it comes to battling!
Strong Trainer!\xfffeTake this!\xf000븁\x0000
Life itself is the journey!\xfffeAnd getting lost is only natural!\xf000븁\x0000You can even find the truth\xfffewhen you're lost!
Heeey, Pokémon!\xfffeHeeey, Pokémooon!\xf000븀\x0000Heeey, are you a Trainer?!\xf000븁\x0000
Tough Pokémon for\xfffea tough Trainer! I lose!
I respect your toughness!\xfffeSo take this!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm watching to see if any Pokémon\xfffePokéShifted from other regions\xf000븀\x0000try to run away!
This place isn't in the guidebook...\xfffeI like to search places like that!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength...!\xfffeI want it in the guidebook!
A journey of new discoveries!\xfffeThat's my theme.\xf000븁\x0000For example, see that big rock?\xfffeYou can push it with Strength!
So there's a peaceful place here,\xfffeside-by-side with a big city...\xf000븁\x0000Whoa! But somehow, it stirs me\xfffeinto a battling mood!\xf000븁\x0000
Whew...\xfffeI've calmed down now.
Pokémon are calmed\xfffeby nature too, surely?\xf000븁\x0000Or do they actually prefer\xfffethe flashiness of the city?
If the roads are linked,\xfffeyou can go anywhere!\xf000븀\x0000If there's an opponent,\xf000븀\x0000you can challenge them!\xf000븁\x0000
I feel the bonds between\xfffeyou and your Pokémon!
I continue my journey\xfffeto drown my sorrows...\xf000븁\x0000But when the seasons change,\xfffeI remember my sorrow anew!
I ride my bicycle,\xfffeI feel the gentle breeze,\xf000븀\x0000and I win Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
A pleasant breeze brings my loss...\xfffe...Actually, it's stopped now. Hm.
I'm surprised I didn't know,\xfffebut Raimon seems to be having\xf000븀\x0000a bicycle-riding craze of sorts!
Bring-ring! ♪\xf000븁\x0000At these speeds,\xfffeI might as well Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
It sucks that I lost, but...\xfffeBring-ring! ♪ Heehee!
When I'm on my bike,\xfffeI can speed up!\xf000븁\x0000When I'm with Pokémon,\xfffeI can do so much!\xf000븁\x0000Achieving what you can't\xfffeis seriously lots of fun!
I'm on patrol!\xfffeI must look into your strength!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength is...\xfffeunfaltering!
With Pokémon and patrols,\xfffethere's nothing to be afraid of!
The harshness of the desert...\xfffeLet me convey it through battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm beat by the desert heat!\xfffeMy mouth is so dry...!
Try not to get burned!\xf000븁\x0000
When a Pokémon is burned,\xfffethe power of physical moves lowers!\xf000븀\x0000So this is pretty handy!
A scorching desert!\xfffeA flaming passion!\xf000븀\x0000And a burning battle!\xf000븁\x0000
It buuurns!
Speed is crucial in\xfffetaking card of a burn!\xf000븁\x0000
In hot or cold, with passion,\xfffeyou'll have no problems!
But... but you're just relaxing!\xfffeHow did you beat busy me?!
My! How powerful...!
Oh!\xfffeFantastic strength, there!
Oh, I see, so I've lost...\xfffeDue to your strength!
Inconceivable...!\xfffeI cannot have lost!
No...\xfffeNo way...!
Your strength surpassed\xfffemy wildest dreams! Gleeeee!!
Ngh! Seriously, just\xfffefor taking somebody's Pokémon?!
We've finally come upon the secret\xfffesleeping near the lighthouse!\xf000븀\x0000You won't get in the way!\xf000븁\x0000
Too bad, so sad...!
By the 200-plus-year-old lighthouse, there\xfffesleeps the mythical Pokémon Victini...!
I've been ordered not to let\xfffeanyone near the Plasma Ship!\xf000븁\x0000
I've failed in battle...!
Even though I lost, I'm not moving!\xfffeOrders FULFILLED!
We're gonna liberate Victini from\xfffethe cramped cellar on this island!\xf000븁\x0000
Stop getting in the way\xfffeof our noble goal...!
Selfish people are\xfffetorturing Victini...
Victini is on this island,\xfffeand it'll make us unlimited energy!\xf000븁\x0000
Why a stupid kid...?!
When you bathe in Victini's energy,\xfffeyou can win any battle!
I lost...\xfffemy grip on victory...!
The opening is key.\xfffeIn battles, and in stories.
...And now begins\xfffemy last chapter.
The epilogue of our story\xfffedraws nearer...
...Ah, I can't believe you've done\xfffethis again! Incredulity is me!\xf000븁\x0000Even with all the words I know,\xfffeI still simply can't express myself.\xf000븁\x0000To put it into words\xfffewould further shackle\xf000븀\x0000my pure feelings...\xf000븁\x0000But allow me to say this...\xfffeYou are even more great!!
That move, and now...?\xfffeYou're as charming as ever!
Now then... However the battle goes,\xfffeI shall not back down.
Even at this rate, I know...\xfffethere is still a way to win!
Whenever anyone wins,\xfffeanother must lose.\xf000븁\x0000That is the essence of a battle.\xf000븁\x0000A good battler does not boast\xfffeof his victory nor fall to distractions,\xf000븀\x0000but simply seeks the next victory.
...Strong as ever!\xfffeYou're making my heart leap!
Last one! I'll shout out\xfffeall my remaining strength!
...Might this be the end?\xfffeI'll put my all into the next attack!
There's no ultimate Pokémon.\xfffeNo best combination ever was...\xf000븁\x0000That's why continuous victory\xfffeis so difficult.\xf000븁\x0000But a heart that seeks strength wants\xfffeto know what it is to be the strongest...\xf000븀\x0000I feel that is precious.\xf000븁\x0000And I respect you,\xfffefor you possess it.
Here begins another wonderful diversion.\xfffeThis is my favorite part of all...
At any time, I won't\xfffebe confused, and I won't clamor...
For my Pokémon who fight with their\xfffebelief placed in me, I shall not give up!
So far...\xfffeNo, so far and beyond...\xf000븁\x0000You'll prove to be a most elegant\xfffeand excellent Trainer, you will.\xf000븁\x0000Your Pokémon carry such dignity\xfffethat it was a joy to face them.
...You think you can\xfffestop us with that?!
My final friend...\xfffeLend me your courage!
Do you mean the world\xfffehas not chosen me, but you?!
With this... my ideal...\xfffePokémon's dreams... they have crumbled...
Your Pokémon seem so...\xfffehappy!
Even if I lose, is the future\xfffeyou see different... or not?
So we were alike...\xfffeBut, you... What are you?
Just how long has it been\xfffesince I've been cornered as such?!
Oh, it's not over yet! Such an enjoyable\xfffebattle can't be ended so simply!
My heart is racing\xfffeafter having experienced\xf000븀\x0000such a tempestuous match...!\xf000븁\x0000You truly are\xfffean amazing Trainer!!
I just bought some new boots,\xfffeso I'm getting them dirty on purpose!\xf000븁\x0000Oh, hey! If I battle you,\xfffethey might get even dirtier!\xf000븁\x0000
Whew! That furious battle\xfffegot me totally soaked!!
When I worry about them getting dirty,\xfffeI'm never happy with my boots.\xf000븁\x0000Aren't Pokémon the same way?\xfffeYou feel bad that they get hurt,\xf000븀\x0000but it helps them get stronger.
If there's a Trainer,\xfffeyou battle them!\xf000븁\x0000So, maybe I can show you\xfffesome water-type Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000you've never seen before!\xf000븁\x0000
I've never seen\xfffesuch a powerful Trainer!
Where there's water,\xfffeI'll plop down my line.\xf000븁\x0000Even in puddles, there could be\xfffewater Pokémon I've never seen!
Know yourself, know your foe,\xfffeknow your surroundings...\xf000븀\x0000That makes you a Ranger!\xf000븁\x0000
But there's still\xfffea lot I don't know!
If you're so prepared,\xfffeI can't be too gloomy!\xf000븁\x0000
I was looking into what\xfffePokémon are in this area.\xf000븁\x0000It makes it easier to decide what\xfffePokémon I should counter with!
Pokémon Trainers build\xfffefriendships through battle!\xf000븁\x0000
This loss...\xfffeIt's bottomlessly meaningful...
Take this Sitrus Berry\xfffeas proof of our friendship!\xf000븁\x0000
If you listen closely, you hear\xfffePokémon cries, footsteps...\xf000븀\x0000and the breath of trees!
I'm tired of always battling\xfffethe same people!\xf000븀\x0000I wanna challenge you!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa! I'm astonished!\xfffeThat move was INTENSE!
The Pokémon Burmy!\xfffeIt changes form depending\xf000븀\x0000on where it fights!\xf000븀\x0000Isn't that cool? Isn't that cool?
YAHHH!!\xf000븁\x0000D...! Don't sneak up on me\xfffefrom behind like that!!\xf000븁\x0000
Man, I lost...\xfffeThat makes me a sad panda...
I've been writing a bunch of\xfffestuff on the wall...\xf000븁\x0000Ah! Don't you DARE look!\xfffe...They're my secrets!
Compare! Whose Pokémon\xfffeare stronger?!\xf000븁\x0000
I give!\xfffeYour Pokémon are strooooong!
I get scraped up lots in these shorts,\xfffebut I'm comfortable with that!\xf000븁\x0000I can get my Pokémon\xfffeto lick my scrapes!
This is our playground!\xf000븁\x0000And the great Landlos\xfffewatches over us!\xf000븁\x0000
Wahaha!\xfffeYour Pokémon look to be having fun!
The great Landlos...\xfffeIs it a gentle and strong Pokémon?
If you have the move Dive,\xfffeyou can dive down in the sea!\xf000븁\x0000
Glub, glub...\xfffe...I'm sinking.
Do your Pokémon know Dive?\xf000븁\x0000Dive is great! Wonderful!\xfffeDive all the time!
As a happenstance of loving to swim,\xfffeI've fought countless wild Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
And from beating the gyms,\xfffeone becomes very strong!
Alright! I'm going to challenge\xfffeall the world's Pokémon gyms!\xf000븁\x0000There's water-type gyms\xfffein Kanto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh...
Me and my Pokémon are\xfffeswimming all the time!\xf000븀\x0000So we battle while swimming, duh!\xf000븁\x0000
...I lost, but you were really good\xfffeat battling while swimming!
They say a temple's sunk down to\xfffethe bottom of Sazanami's bay!
Pokémon and Pokémon\xfffefacing off with their moves...\xf000븀\x0000What an adventure!\xf000븁\x0000
...So our hopping adventure\xfffeis over already...
For me, vacation is year-round...\xfffeWhat fantastic things should I do?
Oh? Did you come to see\xfffeCynthia in her swimsuit?\xf000븁\x0000
Why don't you get off your Pokémon\xfffeand go swimming yourself, huh?
...I hear that when no one's around,\xfffeCynthia secretly goes swimming.\xf000븁\x0000Talk about an awesome rumor!\xfffeOr at least, supposedly-awesome.
The calming waves of Sazanami Town\xfffemake me feel wonderful!\xf000븁\x0000
Your fighting style is\xfffemuch wilder, but still impressive!
Floating on the waves feels great!\xfffeBeing with Pokémon feels great!
After much study, I've learned that\xfffethe night is still full of mystery!\xf000븁\x0000
Do I need to get along with my\xfffePokémon better? It is a mystery!
I've been reading some of\xfffeProfessor Juniper's books lately.\xf000븁\x0000The origins of Pokémon\xfffeare still a mystery...
I'm studying up on\xfffeVillage Bridge, but...\xf000븀\x0000It's important to take a breather!\xf000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon...\xfffeWhat admirable support you provide!
Village Bridge is supported by\xfffecountless bricks so it won't collapse.\xf000븁\x0000And for a hundred years,\xfffeit's been kept that way!
I've journeyed, and I know!\xfffeEveryone loves Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000Surely you do, too?\xf000븁\x0000
I lost,\xfffebut our adventure goes on!
From here on, we will walk!\xfffeAs long as the roads go on...\xf000븀\x0000As long as there are Pokémon!
You're the 99th person\xfffeI've given this greeting!\xf000븁\x0000Let's Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you!\xfffeWe're already friends now!
Wherever in the world you are,\xfffeyou can always battle Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000So it's nice having a greeting!
My moves don't got\xfffenearly enough power in 'em!
My steps are all off!\xfffeBetter redo my lessons!
Man, my footwork...!\xfffeIt's the worst!
PLASMAAAAA!\xfffeI fell in the Ancient Castle...
The strength that brought down\xfffeLord N... I feel it in my bones! Ow!
So this is the Trainer who protected\xfffeour world of coexisting with Pokémon...
I'll hit you with everything\xfffeI've gained on this journey!
...My Pokémon and I will show you\xfffethe full extent of our power!

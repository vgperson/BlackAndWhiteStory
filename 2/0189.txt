A Trainer catches another Trainer's eye.\xfffeThat is the start of a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
What?!\xfffeYou are too strong!
I'll go into the tall grass and\xfffehave battles with wild Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut, before that, I have to visit\xfffethe Pokémon Center to heal up my team.
I really love Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe'Cause my cute Pokémon will do its best\xfffein a really cute way!\xf000븁\x0000
Even though it lost,\xfffemy Pokémon is still cute!
I'll make my cute Pokémon even stronger\xfffeby having battles with lots of Trainers!
Lillipup, Lillipup!\xfffeMy Lillipup! Go!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon uses those kinds of moves?!
Different Trainers use\xfffedifferent kinds of Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's fun to see, isn't it?
Check out how much my Pokémon\xfffehave grown up!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh. I guess they're still pretty green.
You are great!\xfffeThis is a present for you.\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you very much.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI learned a lot about how I should\xfffetrain my Pokémon from battling you.
Your Pokémon look quite good!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWould you show me how\xfffeyou've been training them?\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, I see!\xfffeYou've trained them by traveling together!
Please, let your precious Pokémon\xfffehave this.\xf000븁\x0000
I guess when Pokémon and Trainers\xfffespend that much time together,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethey naturally understand each other!
I feel invincible because I am surrounded\xfffeby the smiles of children and Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Great, great!\xfffeYou are very strong!
Speak while making eye contact, and\xfffeexpress your feelings to each other...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's the same for people and Pokémon.

Kumi: Come on, Pokémon! Get up! Go!\xfffeAmy: Oh, no! Our Pokémon burned out...

Eh? Only one Pokémon?\xfffeAre you really a Trainer?



You have only one Pokémon?\xfffeAre you really a Trainer?
Hey! Trainer!\xfffeHave a battle with me!\xf000븁\x0000
Oops. I have no healthy Pokémon\xfffeleft to fight...
Argh! You went all out against a kid!\xfffe...Actually, that's a good thing. Thanks!
Take this!\xfffeHyper Beam!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoops...
Hyper Beam?\xfffeOh, my Pokémon can't really use it yet.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't know very much about Pokémon,\xfffeso I just want to use really cool moves.
Trainer! \xfffeI wanna play with you.\xf000븁\x0000
Trainer!\xfffeYou too strong!
When I get big, I wanna be\xfffea strong, cool Trainer, too!
Now I get to show off everything\xfffeI learned in the Trainers' School!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh...
I was so overwhelmed by your greatness\xfffethat I forgot everything I learned!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI need to keep my wits during a battle.
I was just thinking\xfffeabout a new battle strategy!\xf000븁\x0000
A new battle strategy only works\xfffeif you stick with it...
I know all kinds of things! Like if you\xfffewalk through the swaying tall grass,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou might find a cool Pokémon!
Even if Pokémon have not been fully\xfffetrained, they can show their potential\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedepending on their Trainer's style.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, that's really frustrating!
I feel sorry for Pokémon when they lose\xfffebecause their Trainer lacks skill...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeA Trainer has a huge responsibility.
The fun of traveling around the world\xfffeis having serious battles\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith a lot of Pokémon I meet!\xf000븁\x0000
Wooo! You're a top-class Trainer,\xfffethe best in the world!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffe...But what do I know?
As long as my Pokémon are with me,\xfffeI can battle Trainers all over the world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe world is so big! Woooooo!\xfffeThat's really exciting!
Where did you come from?\xfffeMe? Well, if you can win, I'll tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
My first battle...\xfffeAnd I lost...
To tell you the truth,\xfffeI just left Castelia City yesterday.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI've just started Pokémon battling, too.
I'm still a rookie, but someday\xfffeI will be a great player!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll improve by having a lot\xfffeof Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
Ugh!\xfffeI missed the rebound!
I won't make excuses for losing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy waste time dreaming up excuses?\xfffeI'll spend that time getting stronger!
A young Trainer! It's important for the\xfffeyoung to get lots of exercise, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000
A good sweat...\xfffeBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
I want a Poké Ball that's\xfffeas big as a basketball!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think it would be more comfortable\xfffefor the Pokémon inside it.
You've been caught by a powerful hook,\xfffewhich is me!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll have a battle with you using\xfffemy freshly caught Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, no! The one who was caught...\xfffewas me!
I usually release the Pokémon I catch.\xfffeThat's called catch and release!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhen I release them, I say these words:\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFarewell, Pokémon.\xfffeIt was a nice fight.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll say these words to you, too.\xfffeIt was a nice fight!
OK! Good catch! Good catch!\xfffeMy next catch will be called victory!\xf000븁\x0000
The victory that got away\xfffewas thiiiiiiiiiis big!
Catch, caught, and catch again...\xfffeLife is fishing!
Ho there! Even in the middle of\xfffeconstruction, a Trainer will battle.\xf000븁\x0000
Gah! I'm digging myself into a big hole!
If you use a Pokémon move called Dig,\xfffeyou can get out of a cave instantly!
I'm a mucho macho Worker!\xfffeI'll bring you down with my muscles!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh!\xfffeThe impudence!
I dismissed you as just a kid...\xfffeNot at all... You're quite a Trainer!
A battle is like a construction project.\xfffeThey're both a piece of cake for me!\xf000븁\x0000
Ooh... That piece of cake was\xfffehard to swallow!
I may have lost in the battle, but I bow\xfffeto nobody when it comes to construction!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou must have something like that, right?\xfffeSomething you do better than anybody?
We've trained by doing physical work!\xfffeOur attacks are super powerful!\xf000븁\x0000
We've trained by doing physical work.\xfffeSo even when we lose, we're powerful!
This Worker is happy to have a job that\xfffelets him be with his favorite Pokémon!
Hi, Trainer!\xfffeLet me turn you into a work of art!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, I just got whitewashed!
The reason why there are so many colors\xfffein this world...white, black, red, green,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeblue, yellow...is that they can be mixed\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto create an explosion of new color!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBoom!
As my mind roams, as the wind blows,\xfffedestiny has brought us to this battle.\xf000븁\x0000
Urgh... I didn't know\xfffeI was flying against the wind...
I want to fly around the Unova region,\xfffeblown by the wind!
This big bag...\xfffeWhat do you think is inside?\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, but now I have more things\xfffeto add to my bag.
I'll tell you a secret. The things I put\xfffein the bag are memories of my journey!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe things you can't see are very heavy!
These Pokémon usually help me bake.\xfffeToday, they'll help me battle you!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, my...\xfffeIt was a tasty battle.
I get on well with my Pokémon, and we\xfffebake bread together. It's so much fun!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't mind getting up early every day.
Turn around, and it's my turn. ♪\xfffeTurn around, and it's your turn.\xf000븁\x0000
Turn around, turn around, turn around...
It's difficult to have a battle while\xfffetapping my toes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I am a Dancer!\xfffeIt is natural to dance!
I will show you all the moves\xfffethat my Pokémon have mastered!\xf000븁\x0000
I am sorry that I underestimated\xfffeyou and your Pokémon's moves!
Sometimes a battle is so beautiful\xfffethat it takes your breath away.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOurs was such a battle!
It is best to try anything!\xfffeYou think so, too, don't you?\xf000븁\x0000
There's a rhythm to attacking\xfffeand defending...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI think ours got thrown off.
The guitar is expression itself.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's enjoy playing the guitar,\xffferather than just talking about it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA Pokémon is also expression itself.\xfffeLet's enjoy battling!
I cannot see the future yet...\xfffeThe world is still to be determined...
Plasmaaaa!\xfffe...What? Did we lose?
I cannot believe that Team Plasma\xfffelost to such kids!
I've finally become a Trainer...\xfffeEverything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying\xfffePokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...\xfffeEverything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying\xfffePokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...\xfffeEverything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying\xfffePokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
Eek! Ouch!\xfffeI won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and\xfffethis isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
Eek! Ouch!\xfffeI won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and\xfffethis isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
Eek! Ouch!\xfffeI won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and\xfffethis isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
More!\xfffeLet me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
I never expected to hear\xfffePokémon say such things...
My Psychic-type Pokémon\xfffejust started making noises.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIs that because we're in the ruins...\xfffeor is it because of you?\xf000븁\x0000
So...strong!\xfffeWho are you?!
It is said that long ago, these ruins\xfffewere the heart of civilization for people\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand Pokémon in the Unova region.
Just being here fills me\xfffewith magical power...\xf000븁\x0000
You seem to be\xfffefull of magical power, too...
In ancient places,\xfffemagical energy remains...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can understand it.\xfffeSo much sorrow and joy...
As if that would work on my Pokémon!
It's not over yet! One more left!\xfffeThis is where I give it my all!
You got me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am...burned...out...
I see...\xfffeThat might be a good attack.
I'll put all of my hopes\xfffeon my last Pokémon!
Lose? Me?\xfffeI don't believe this.
Ah!\xfffeMy Pokémon!
Huh? Could it be?\xfffeCould I have only one Pokémon left?
Er...\xfffeIs it over now?
Welcome to Striaton Gym!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCare for a taste of battle?\xfffeI'll serve up the first course!\xf000븁\x0000
Yow!\xfffeYou're a Trainer with a lot of pepper!
I think it is all right to move ahead\xfffewith Pokémon you've trained well, even\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewithout thinking about type matchups.
The specialty of Striaton Gym--\xfffethe full-course “Trainer de luxe!"\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm your second course.\xf000븁\x0000
That was one of our most popular dishes.\xfffeDid you enjoy the battle?
The specialty of Striaton Gym--\xfffethe full-course “Trainer de luxe!"\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTo complete your repast--a Gym Leader.
Now, with that move, I'm starting to see\xfffewhat kind of Trainer you are!
No matter how grim the situation, I'll use my\xffferesearch skills to find a winning strategy!
My theory about you was correct.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're more than just talented...\xfffeYou're motivated! I salute you!
I hang around Nacrene Gym all the time.\xfffePeople call me a bookworm.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll warn you now... I am strong because\xfffeI spend the entire day either\xf000븀\x0000\xfffereading books or training Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
I may be a bookworm,\xfffebut I am not a bug Pokémon.
My first recommendation is a book called\xfffe“Nice to Meet You, Pokémon."\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe bookshelves for children's books\xfffeare close to the entrance.
Oh, wow!\xfffeI lost, but thanks for a great battle!
I've never known anyone so powerful.\xfffeMy head is empty compared to yours!
Snick!\xfffeMy switch was turned on!
Could it be time to bug out of here?\xfffeNo, no. I refuse to be squashed!
Is it over?\xfffeHas my muse abandoned me?
You and your Pokémon...\xfffeare shining brilliantly!
A properly dramatic victory requires\xfffea dash of danger and a pinch of peril.
I meant to make your head spin,\xfffebut you shocked me instead.
Even though I lost,\xfffeI'm an ocean of calm...
Welcome, challenger!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will do you the greatest of honors\xfffeand accept your challenge!\xf000븁\x0000
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll on!\xfffeRoller coaster!
I was aiming for a fighting style\xfffethat overwhelms you with speed...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I can move faster than my opponents,\xfffeI will get the upper hand.
I lost, but I will think a lot harder,\xfffeand that will make me a lot stronger!
Your fashion sense...\xfffeIt's kind of Nuvema Town-ish.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, no!\xfffeI thought I'd be the fashionista!
Elesa controls an elegant Gym\xfffein elegant Nimbasa City.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeShe has an essential elegance.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou should be her fan, too!
I'll be!\xfffeSure didn't see that coming.
Givin' up's the easy way out! If I wanted,\xfffeI could have given up any old time!
Well, I've had enough... And just so you\xfffeknow, I didn't go easy on you.
When I think about a match\xfffewith a fabulous Trainer like you,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit's like I'm walking on air!
This is my last Pokémon...\xfffeBut I'll never give up hope!
Being your opponent in battle is a new\xfffesource of strength to me. Thank you!
I became a Pilot, which has been\xfffemy dream since I was a child.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI am extremely strong! Bring it on!\xf000븁\x0000
Altitude is dropping slowly...\xfffeI will prepare for landing.
I became a Pilot, making the dream\xfffeof my younger days a reality...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThe weight is quite comfortable.
Target lock acquired!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will shoot you down\xfffewith my flight technique!\xf000븁\x0000
What?!\xfffeI missed the target.
We can depend on a move that\xfffehits without fail when it counts.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor example, Aerial Ace and Swift\xfffeare both surefire moves!
The best Trainer of Ice-type Pokémon\xfffein the Cold Storage...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's me!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, no... I will train even harder\xfffeat the Icirrus Gym.
The Gym Leader in Icirrus City\xfffeuses Ice-type Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you train your body and mind there,\xfffeyou'll be fine with cold!
The pure chill of the Cold Storage!\xfffeTaste how cold it is!\xf000븁\x0000
Chilly?\xfffeI feel the shiver pass along my spine.
There are a lot of Trainers,\xfffeeven in the Cold Storage.



We!\xfffeWe are training here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow let's train\xfffePokémon together!\xf000븁\x0000
Great!\xfffeYou have a talent as a Trainer!
I want to win against Gym Leaders,\xfffebut I want to win against you, too!
My goal is to outperform Gym Leaders!\xfffeCan you win against me?!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon fought well, didn't they?
I have my goal!\xfffeMy Pokémon are there for me!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's why I can keep trying!
POWER!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePower is essential for both\xfffePokémon and football!\xf000븁\x0000
Didn't I have enough power...?
I am training to be the very best\xfffewith my Pokémon!
An elegant Smasher\xfffehas an elegant battle!\xf000븁\x0000
E-e-even though I lost,\xfffeI won't panic.
Because I am a lady, I won't\xfffebe chagrined at losing the battle!
The qualifying round is coming soon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will practice smashes\xfffeby using you as a wall!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.\xfffeThat was some good training...
You and I have just met!\xfffeLet's start this game from the beginning.
One-two, one-two! Keep time with\xfffeeach other, and one-two punch!\xf000븁\x0000
Mayo: Two of us keeping time together...\xfffeAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMay: Two of us keeping time together...\xfffeAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
It would be even greater if we knew\xfffewhat two Pokémon will do.
You've got only one Pokémon,\xfffeso we cannot fight.
We discuss what to do\xfffebefore a battle.\xf000븁\x0000

What I've heard is it's good to use\xfffeEarthquake when your ally is floating!
If you want to have a battle with us, \xfffeyou need two Pokémon.
...Interrupting us!\xfffeWhat a horrible Trainer!
If you take something away,\xfffeI will take it back... Remember that!
Look, look! This is a Gym Badge\xfffefrom Striaton City!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, you have it, too!\xfffeThen let's have a Pokémon battle\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto see who is stronger!\xf000븁\x0000
Impressive! A battle with a\xfffeGym Badge holder is different!
You know, there's a pedestal at the\xfffeentrance of each Pokémon Gym.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you get that Gym's Badge,\xfffeyour name will be carved there.
I patrol Pinwheel Forest every day!\xfffeA battle here is a piece of cake!\xf000븁\x0000
What a huge mistake to lose\xfffea battle in Pinwheel Forest!
A Ranger always has one of these.\xfffeI'll give it to you!\xf000븁\x0000
The forest is alive...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSomething changes every day,\xfffeso it's fun to patrol!
Blend into the wilderness\xfffeand talk to Pokémon with your heart.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat is a Ranger!\xf000븁\x0000
Did you feel my wildness?
I'm sure you can fully\xfffeutilize this.\xf000븁\x0000
If you blend into the wilderness too well,\xfffeyou won't be noticed by Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelet alone by people.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat is a problem...
Come on! Let's take\xfffea deep breath.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeInhale, exhale.\xfffeInhale, exhale.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll right! Next,\xfffelet our Pokémon fight!\xf000븁\x0000
In this situation...\xfffeAll that comes out is a sigh...
Well, a sigh and this lovely gift for you!\xf000븁\x0000
Different Pokémon can be found\xfffein different places.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDoes that mean there is\xfffea perfect place for everyone?
Get great powers drawn from nature\xfffewithout opposing it.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat is the strength of Rangers!\xf000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon make a great team!
This is one of the powers\xfffeI got from nature.\xf000븁\x0000
Even the things you can't do alone,\xfffeif you're with someone else...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right. We always\xfffehave Pokémon around us.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIsn't that great?
Why do Pokémon and people\xfffestay together...?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's the theme of my research.\xf000븁\x0000
A ray of light shone in...\xfffeI feel a little like that.
Why do Pokémon and people\xfffestay together...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think we stick together\xfffebecause we are different.
If I apply what I just learned\xfffeto the battle, I think I can win!\xf000븁\x0000
I've even won against my teacher, though...
Knowing something and being\xfffeable to do it seem pretty similar,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut they can be very different.
My Pokémon's strong points!\xfffeYou'll see them if you fight!\xf000븁\x0000
Hey! Did you see\xfffemy Pokémon's strong points?!
My Pokémon's strong points?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHmmm...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't know 'cause there are too many!
When it's cold, wear a lot of clothes!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnly humans could come up\xfffewith something so clever!\xf000븁\x0000
How we struggle in vain at the end\xfffealso shows how clever humans are!
I'll tell you something clever.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you use a Fire-type move on a Pokémon\xfffethat is frozen solid, the ice will melt!
Although I am in the Cold Storage,\xfffemy heart is burning!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, no!
Some Pokémon grow stronger\xfffewhen they get colder,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhile some Pokémon love hot places.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! Everyone is different!\xfffeEvery Pokémon is different!
You're pretty energetic,\xfffeconsidering the cold place we're in!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's warm up with a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I warmed up, but I lost the battle,\xfffeand my heart is freezing...
I am storing thick fat\xfffeto resist the cold.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...I didn't just get fat.\xfffePlease don't get me wrong.
...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...R-ready to b-battle?\xf000븁\x0000
...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...I'm sh-shivering!
...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Kn-know what?\xfffe...Th-this place is cold.
A traveling Backpacker\xfffemeets a traveling Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000
I may have been traveling\xfffeto meet you... Just kidding!
My journey taught me that a journey\xfffeis not just going somewhere.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMeeting people and learning from them\xfffeare both part of my journey.
I wanted to go to the Celestial Tower...\xfffebut I got lost and stranded.\xf000븁\x0000
Ah! I cannot go anywhere\xfffeif I am stopping!
To go to the Celestial Tower...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWalk along the road! That's right!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you keep walking, someday\xfffeyou'll arrive at your destination.
Oh! A Pokédex!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI see. That is the reason\xfffefor your journey!\xf000븁\x0000
Impressive! That's what you'd expect\xfffefrom the owner of a Pokédex!
I've heard that both Professor Junipers\xfffewere Backpackers when they were young.
My travel partner is a Pokémon\xfffethat a popular guidebook recommended!\xf000븁\x0000
The guidebook does not tell me\xfffehow to win.
According to the popular guidebook,\xfffeNimbasa City is an entertainment city.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt must be full of fun!
Do you want to pass through here?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen, you must greet me!\xf000븁\x0000
You!!\xfffeWhat great strength you have!
For a child like you, \xfffea Bicycle is just right!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt is healthier, isn't it?
Heheh!\xfffeNobody can beat my speed and fury!\xf000븁\x0000
I have lost!\xfffeI am such a loser!
Ah! I wish I could fly down\xfffea much, much bigger road.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThe Pokémon would be happy, too!
Hey, hey, what have we here, boys?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou have good Pokémon.\xfffeLet me see!\xf000븁\x0000
Jim: G-good Pokémon.\xfffeTo be honest, they are dazzling!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCas: WHAT?\xfffeHow could bad men like us lose...?
There are good Pokémon,\xfffebut there are no bad Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEverything is up to the Trainer.\xfffeThat's what I think!
You've got only one Pokémon?\xfffeA single battle is so boring!
Hey, hey! A bad one teamed up\xfffewith another bad one!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you know what it means?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat means we are very bad!\xf000븁\x0000

Even bad men like us\xfffecan be friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat a great thing!\xfffeFriendship between men\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand friendship with Pokémon...
What? You've only got one\xfffePokémon that can fight?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI cannot take a cheap shot,\xfffefighting two against one!
I'm a little bit strong.\xfffeI will work out!\xf000븁\x0000
I got worked over...
You're quite strong.\xfffeYou have left the Little League!
Hey!\xfffeHey, let's practice together!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have to warn you--I will go all out\xfffeeven if we are just practicing!\xf000븁\x0000
I was no match for you...\xfffeThere is always someone better.
I promise you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will learn from this experience\xfffeand become an even better player!
There is no end\xfffeto mastering Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
There is an end\xfffefor this battle!
It's hard to have no end,\xfffebut if you change your perspective,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou'll see we can enjoy them forever!
I want to know how\xfffethe fighting Pokémon feel.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I fight, too.\xfffeThat's me, a Battle Girl!\xf000븁\x0000
When I lose, I cry with my Pokémon!\xfffeThat's me, a Battle Girl!
When you train every day,\xfffeyour body moves as you like.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt feels really good!
I test the challenge rock\xfffewith my fist every day!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt is important to make steady progress,\xfffelittle by little.\xf000븁\x0000
I still have not\xfffetried hard enough!
I test the challenge rock every day\xfffewith my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhy don't you check out\xfffethe challenge rock\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewith a Fighting-type Pokémon?
I am pleased to meet you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease allow me to introduce you\xfffeto my Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
I had the honor of meeting\xfffeyour Pokémon!
Well, well, you are strong!\xfffeI admire you.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI would like to learn by watching you!
Clerks exchange business cards.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTrainers, of course, greet each other\xfffewith a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
What an impressive greeting!\xfffeThat was a great Pokémon battle!
When I was a child,\xfffeI traveled with Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOf course, I am still raising Pokémon!\xfffe'Cause Pokémon are my friends for life!
My work is a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Today's work\xfffedidn't go well...
Our company develops goods\xfffefor Pokémon and Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, Pokémon battles are also\xfffean important part of my work!
I received intense training from Clay.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo Trainer around here\xfffeis out of my league.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, no...\xfffeI've found someone who's out of my league!
Clay is a Gym Leader and\xfffea company president.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd he scolds me all the time.
I was about to take a break,\xfffethen I met you!\xf000븁\x0000
This encounter was a good one...\xfffefor you!
I met my Pokémon\xfffemore than ten years ago.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI trust them.
Even the battle I lost\xfffewill be a bittersweet memory...
Wow, you really cleaned up!
When Pokémon Trainers meet,\xfffewhat we do is, of course,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeengage in a Pokémon battle, don't we?\xf000븁\x0000
Oh no...\xfffeI'm pathetic...
Perhaps I meet people here because of\xfffeguidance from my Pokémon.
Oh?\xfffeYou want to have a battle with me?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll right!\xfffeI have a strong Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
That's right.\xfffeThe Pokémon is no longer with me.
...The Pokémon is no longer with me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...That's not true.\xfffeAs long as I remember,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit will be with me forever.
If you like, I will make\xfffeyour Pokémon healthy!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever! Let me challenge you\xfffeto a battle first!\xf000븁\x0000
What? \xfffeDid MY Pokémon lose energy?
Now, as I promised,\xfffeI will make your Pokémon healthy.\xf000븁\x0000
To make people healthy,\xfffeDoctors go where they are needed.
During a long journey,\xfffeyou'll be happy if you meet a Doctor.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you can win against me,\xfffeI'll make your Pokémon healthy!\xf000븁\x0000
Your team is very healthy. Let me\xfffejust fix your team up a little bit...
After a Pokémon battle,\xfffelet them recover slowly.\xf000븁\x0000
Health is always crucial!\xfffeIt really is.
I've survived a lot of fierce battles\xfffewith my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI don't think I will lose!\xf000븁\x0000
The one who survived\xfffefierce battles was you?!
My heart is not broken.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will survive further fierce battles\xfffewith my Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand I will become much stronger.
Take this!\xfffeThe winning strategy I've developed!\xf000븁\x0000
Sigh...\xfffeI feel down.
I feel down only briefly!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am a Trainer. If I give up,\xfffemy Pokémon cannot do anything! Right?
I will test you to see whether\xfffeyou have what it takes...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeto aim for the Pokémon League!\xf000븁\x0000
I see! I see, I see!\xfffeI see, I see, I see, I see!
They say that there is a strong Champion\xfffein the Pokémon League.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSomeday, I will be able to challenge\xfffethe Pokémon League!
I am an Ace Trainer!\xfffeBasically, I am very strong.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Unova region will be shaken\xfffeif I lose.\xf000븁\x0000
...The meaning of my existence\xfffeis being threatened right now!
Someday, your existence will shake\xfffethis Unova region!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy loss looks more impressive\xfffeif I praise you as a hotshot.
Hey! My Pokémon are great.\xfffeLook, look!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh!
I am called an Ace Trainer, but\xfffethat doesn't sit well with me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe'Cause I just love Pokémon,\xfffeand I just want to be strong!
Even at an electrified place like this,\xfffeif somebody challenges me,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will take that challenge.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat is an Ace Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
Hmmm...\xfffeI am electrified!
Bits of knowledge about electricity!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAn electric current runs from plus\xfffeto minus, and an electron runs\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefrom minus to plus.
I'm really serious about training.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI even visit this electrified cave\xfffeto train myself and my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
The electric shock racing...\xfffeMe falling down...
Some Pokémon like to live\xfffein this electrified cave...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't you think that people\xfffeshould stay out?
I've improved my ability\xfffeby fighting strong opponents,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecatching them, and overtaking them!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're strong!\xfffeI'll overtake you at all costs!\xf000븁\x0000
I was far from catching up with you...\xfffeYou are no ordinary person!!
No time to feel down after a defeat!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf moaning over a loss made me strong,\xfffeI would bemoan a loss forever, though.
What pleases sleeping spirits\xfffeis a hot Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
It's a spark of your flaming spirit!
When I come here... At Celestial Tower,\xfffestrangely, I feel the urge to fight.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDoes that prove I am alive?
I'm here to understand the end\xfffeof the world, but I don't quite get it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I have a battle,\xfffewill I be enlightened...?\xf000븁\x0000
The end...\xfffeIs that it?
People, Pokémon...\xfffeEven if the world is gone,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat is not the end.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI feel sure of it.
Indescribable energy\xfffeis flowing to me!\xf000븁\x0000
The energy is escaping...\xfffeAww...
A lot of energies are swirling\xfffearound in the world,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeincluding hopes and dreams.
...I still want to fight!\xfffeWandering spirits command me!\xf000븁\x0000
Lemme breathe a sec...\xfffeThe spirits have calmed down a bit.
In a way...the Celestial Tower\xfffeis a space full of desires to live.
Watching a practice makes you feel\xfffethat you are stronger, too,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedoesn't it?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo let's have a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Hawk: ...I could not\xfffedo it well at all.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDar: ...I could not\xfffedo it right at all.
They can do even the hardest things\xfffeas if they were so simple...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the great thing\xfffeabout professionals.
We cannot have\xfffea one-on-two battle.
We were watching various team sports,\xfffeand we wanted to fight as a duo, too!\xf000븁\x0000

Playing as a team is difficult.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe could do more great things\xfffeif we could understand what\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeother people were thinking!
We would like to have\xfffea Pokémon battle as a duo.
I get excited just by\xfffecoming to this stadium!!\xf000븁\x0000
Joe: I got super excited!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRoss: What a thrill!\xfffeIt's taking my breath away!
Just by being here! Just by watching it!\xfffeI get really excited!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I played a game here,\xfffeI would be extremely excited!
We don't want to have\xfffea one-on-two battle.
If we fight in this stadium,\xfffedon't you think we will understand\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehow our star players feel?\xf000븁\x0000

We had a battle with Pokémon\xfffein the stadium...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am happy 'cause I experienced\xfffewhat star players feel!
One-on-two? \xfffeWe cannot fight like that.
Watching people practicing\xfffemakes me want to get moving, too!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSoooooo, let's practice\xfffePokémon battles.\xf000븁\x0000
Masa: I laugh even though\xfffewe lost because it was fun!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYas: Ah! I didn't cheer enough\xfffefor our Pokémon.
It's way more fun to have a battle\xfffeourselves than watching\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeother people practicing!
We cannot have\xfffea one-on-two battle.
We usually cheer for other people,\xfffebut today we would like\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto gather our courage\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand have our own Pokémon battle.\xf000븁\x0000

I am not good at sports,\xfffebut I enjoy sports in my own way--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby cheering my heart out for people!
You have only one Pokémon\xfffethat can fight. It's out of the question.
Watching athletes practice with Pokémon\xfffemade me want to have a Pokémon battle.\xf000븁\x0000
Kay: Great!\xfffeYou are like a professional!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAli: How did you know?
Ohhh... I knew it was difficult\xfffeto fight with Pokémon as well as\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe professionals do.
We are two!\xfffeWe use two Pokémon, too!
Pokémon do\xfffewhat I cannot do.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou know how wonderful this is,\xfffedon't you?\xf000븁\x0000

Even existing sports shine\xfffewith new appeal\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhen they team up with Pokémon!
Aren't you in trouble if you don't have\xfffemore Pokémon that can fight?
Which do you like better,\xfffetennis or basketball?\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: The game ended\xfffebefore I knew what was going on.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEira: The combination of you\xfffeand your Pokémon is great!
I love both tennis and basketball!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can't choose just one of them, just\xfffelike I can't choose my favorite Pokémon.
What? You have only one\xfffePokémon that can fight?
We are always together!\xfffeOur combination play must be great!\xf000븁\x0000

Be in sync with your partner,\xfffeand with your Pokémon, too.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTag Battles are tough!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut if you are in sync,\xfffeit will be very exciting!
You have only one\xfffehealthy Pokémon...?
Real Fishermen are impatient!\xfffeSo we must battle immediately!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost!\xfffeIt's the end!!
How do I know that real Fishermen\xfffeare so impatient?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause we change places frantically\xfffeif we cannot catch Pokémon!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\xfffephysical therapy for me and my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
My tackle was supposed to crush\xfffeeven Rock-type Pokémon...
I was injured in a rough game, so\xfffeI am undergoing some physical therapy.
Join our team!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeActually, I will force you\xfffeto join our team!\xf000븁\x0000
Our team doesn't need a Trainer\xfffewho is quite that strong!
We are cooooool!\xfffeWe hang out here every day!
If I win, give me your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
That was just a joke.\xfffeYou didn't have to take it so seriously!
Bah! I haven't fallen so low\xfffethat I would steal somebody's Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelike Team Plasma!
Mua-ha-ha! I will leave here\xfffefor Victory Road.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's my hobby to win against Trainers!\xf000븁\x0000
I can't believe this!
Rather than enjoying defeating someone,\xfffeshould I aim higher...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI guess the Pokémon League is the place\xfffeto find a better class of challengers.
Words are unnecessary!\xfffeI can understand everything if we battle.\xf000븁\x0000
...
Though people and Pokémon\xfffecannot communicate with words,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewe can communicate with our hearts!
I trained and trained like a madman,\xfffeand my Pokémon trained even more!\xf000븁\x0000
Yeah! Yeah!\xfffeEven though I lost, I'm energetic!
My Fighting-type Pokémon!\xfffeI train it to smash the challenge rock!
You are strong!\xfffeNo, both you and your Pokémon are strong!
Extreme conditions\xfffereally test you and train you!
The wonderful combination\xfffeof you and your Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhat a beautiful friendship!
The pain of my Pokémon...\xfffeI feel it, too!
No! Not yet!\xfffeNo! We can fight on!!
Aghhhh...\xfffeI did my best, but we lost...
I didn't see that coming.\xfffeYou are a very difficult opponent.
Now is the moment of truth!\xfffeThis really gets my blood pumping!
This intense feeling that floods\xfffeme after a defeat...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI don't know how to describe it.
Meow, meow, meow!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis sign means\xfffehave a battle with me!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you for having a battle\xfffewith me!
Meow, meow, meow!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am copying the Pokémon\xfffeI used to live with.
Victory Road!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'll test myself by fighting against you\xfffeto see if I am ready to climb it!\xf000븁\x0000
Agh...\xfffeWas it too early for me?!
Victory Road!\xfffeIt is really amazing!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the road to\xfffethe Pokémon League!
I'm a Hiker exploring caves.\xfffeI will teach you the harshness of life\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand the difficulty of Pokémon battles.\xf000븁\x0000
Well...\xfffeGuess I'll take a hike.
In the caves...\xfffePokémon lurk in the piles of dirt!
Conquering a mountain means\xfffeconquering your fears!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCan you win against Pokémon\xfffethat have conquered many mountains?\xf000븁\x0000
You conquered a B-list mountain.\xfffeThat B-lister is me!
Hikers aim at summits.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon Trainers aim\xfffefor the Pokémon League!
You need a Nurse's help?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSure, if you can win against me,\xfffeI'll make your Pokémon healthy!\xf000븁\x0000
Come on!\xfffeYour team is really healthy!
OK! Then...\xfffeTime to give your Pokémon some energy!\xf000븁\x0000
It's wonderful that each Pokémon and\xfffeeach person can do something special!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMe, I know how to make Pokémon healthy!
Welcome to the Battle Company!\xfffeSince you are here, battle with me.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI won't take no for an answer!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, dear. Aren't you being\xfffetoo hard on me?
In the Battle Company, the stronger you\xfffeare, the higher the floor you work on.
Hee hee! I am better at Pokémon battles\xfffethan I am at work!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm good at Pokémon, but I still lost!
A competent woman is\xfffeas good at Pokémon battles\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeas she is at her work!
Clay is at the bottom of the Gym,\xfffebut I will test you to see\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhether you are skilled enough\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto face the Gym Leader.\xf000븁\x0000
Agh, so frustrating!\xfffeMaybe I'm not skilled enough...
I started Pokémon battles\xfffeafter I grew up,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut I got so into it!
Pouring rain... ♪\xfffeFighting Pokémon... ♪\xf000븁\x0000
Ah, hear the sad melody\xfffeof a total defeat...
Rain is a wonderful melody\xfffethat nature plays! ♪
Water fun with Pokémon!\xfffeDo you want to play with us?\xf000븁\x0000
Uh-oh... I lost.\xfffeBut it was fun, so I'm satisfied.
Aquatic sports with Pokémon!\xfffeNothing is more fun than that!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's 100% impossible to live\xfffewithout Pokémon.
The splish-splosh sounds! Those were\xfffeyour footsteps, weren't they?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo cute!\xf000븁\x0000
You are so strong--too strong to be cute!
According to footstep fortune-telling...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThose whose footsteps make a splish and\xfffea splosh are Trainers that Pokémon like.
If you turn a parasol around,\xfffeit's like a flower blossoming in the rain!\xf000븁\x0000
Ack...\xfffeCome on!
On rainy days, use a parasol,\xfffewear a coat, or get wet.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDo as you like!
I am a Rich Boy,\xfffeso I have a great Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I am a Rich Boy. Even though I lost,\xfffeI'm not frustrated! Bah!
I am a Rich Boy. I will go on a shopping\xfffespree to make myself feel better!
Even when I am resting from\xfffetoo much shopping, I'm willing to battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, no! I'm still the one to beat\xfffein shopping competitions, though!
I'm very rich, but even I am\xfffepleased with the selection\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeat this shopping mall. I want to buy more!
I will show you how energetic\xfffeI've become just by being here!\xf000븁\x0000
Naaatuuure!
If I use this, will my Pokémon\xfffealso become energetic?\xf000븁\x0000
When we are surrounded by green,\xfffewe feel more energetic. Don't you think?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThank you, Mother Nature!
We are totally in sync!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeUsing our amazing connection,\xfffeI will teach you all about Rangers!\xf000븁\x0000
In fact, we learned\xfffeall about you!
Do you know much\xfffeabout this Berry?\xf000븁\x0000
Listen carefully...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou may hear the sound\xfffeof breathing Pokémon and plants.
Mother Nature changes her look\xfffeaccording to the seasons...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's something I cherish!\xf000븁\x0000
OK!\xfffeYou seem to cherish nature!
When seasons change,\xfffeMother Nature gives us this.\xf000븁\x0000
Nature changes,\xfffeand Pokémon evolve...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow can people change?
It takes 20 or even 30 years\xfffefor a tree to be fully grown!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWill you have a Pokémon battle\xfffethat pleases the trees?\xf000븁\x0000
I did my best...\xfffeI am satisfied!
This is what a tree gave me!\xf000븁\x0000
It's a slow business,\xfffegrowing a tree.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo need to rush.\xfffeRaise strong Pokémon slowly.
I'll show you our style.\xfffeMy Pokémon and nature are in harmony.\xf000븁\x0000
Wasn't our style worthy?
What do you let your Pokémon have?\xfffeWhat is their style?\xf000븁\x0000
First, we'll create our own style!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause I am hopeless\xfffeat social niceties and fashions!
It blends in among the trees and grass,\xfffeand it shows its strength.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSee the strength of my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
What I wanted to see\xfffewas not YOUR strength...
This is what Pokémon love.\xfffeHere, take some!\xf000븁\x0000
There is nature and there are cities,\xfffeand it's lovely to have the choice.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBoth people and Pokémon\xfffecan choose their favorite places!
Hm! You are an interesting case!\xfffePlease help me with my experiment!\xf000븁\x0000
Hm-hum! It's difficult to get a result\xfffewith this method.
When the wind blows, seeds fly.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen seeds fly, flowers bloom.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen the flowers bloom, we'll get seeds.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEverything is connected!
Just because I am a Scientist,\xfffepeople think I am so serious!\xf000븁\x0000
Shocking! Nooooo waaaay!\xfffeI loooooost!
To turn a ridiculous idea\xfffeinto a reality...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeScience can make much more happen\xfffethan everyone thinks!
Oh! An unfamiliar face!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo help scientific progress,\xfffeplease lend me a hand!\xf000븁\x0000
Instead of lending a hand,\xfffeyou gave me a workout!
I don't know if science will make everyone\xfffehappy, but if I believe it will, that\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehelps me do my best. That's a fact.
I want to solve!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll the mysteries!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn the world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor that purpose! I will keep fighting!\xf000븁\x0000
Whether I win or lose!\xfffeMysteries only deepen!
I don't think I can solve\xfffeall mysteries by myself!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever! If I can discover something new\xfffeand help someone, I will be satisfied!
I've found a wonderful Trainer!\xfffeI will research you immediately!\xf000븁\x0000
The results of my research have revealed\xfffethat you are the best!
It is very exciting\xfffeto unlock the secrets\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeof Pokémon and their Trainers.
I love this place! The electricity\xfffecharges up my inspiration!\xf000븁\x0000
Aha!  \xfffeThat made a light bulb go on in my head!
When a person moves,\xfffeelectric signals travel in the body!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlso, when a person has an inspiration,\xfffeelectric signals travel to the brain!
Pokémon and Poké Balls\xfffeare my real friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJoin the training of\xfffeour Pokémon Eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I must still be green!\xfffeI have plenty of guts, though!
Both my Pokémon and I\xfffestill haven't gotten enough practice...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIn terms of levels, that would be five...
I am about to give a lecture\xfffeon the strength created by gathering\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea proper balance of different Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Bam! You lectured me!\xfffeWhat a great Trainer!
Team play with Pokémon\xfffebrought new fun to our sport.
My dad is working in a Gym!\xfffeI am receiving special training there!\xf000븁\x0000
...Dad.\xfffe...I couldn't win.
I have Pokémon battles with my dad, too.\xfffeMy dad and I are quite evenly matched!
Workers carry Pokémon and loads.\xfffeI am a Youngster.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am close to my Pokémon,\xfffeand we all cooperate happily!\xf000븁\x0000
Ummmm! You're closer\xfffeto your Pokémon than I am!
It never occurred to you that\xfffethe Pokémon you find around containers\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecame here from another place?
Sometimes you find more than just strong\xfffePokémon in the tall grass!\xf000븁\x0000
Strooooong!\xfffeWhat a Trainer!!
I will grow better and better\xfffeby fighting Pokémon in the tall grass!
Oh!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOhhh?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhat?! That's not a Pokémon,\xfffejust an ordinary Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
You are not an ordinary Trainer.\xfffeYou are a strong Trainer!!
Have you heard that when tall grass\xfffewaves in the breeze,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffea rare Pokémon jumps out?
These are special Pokémon\xfffeI just caught!\xf000븁\x0000
I just caught them\xfffeand have not raised them yet!
OK! I will catch some different Pokémon\xfffein Pinwheel Forest and have more friends!
OK! I'm brave and I'm bold!\xfffeLet's get right to the battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Pfft...\xfffeMy bold bravery is vanishing into the air...
I will tell you 'cause you're strong!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnly one piece of the challenge rock\xfffewill be chipped off each day!
I wanted to captivate you,\xfffebut I feel like I slipped and fell!
I've seen a lot of Trainers!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou seem to have the same aura\xfffethat I felt from strong Trainers.\xf000븁\x0000
Exactly!\xfffeYour aura is exactly what I felt!
You have abundant kindness\xfffeas well as strength.
I'm the best around here.\xfffeCan you possibly be a match for me?\xf000븁\x0000
Your talent and sense...\xfffeBoth are dazzling.
Perhaps the secret of your strength\xfffeis your commitment.
I am a Waiter who is good\xfffeat Pokémon battles.\xf000븁\x0000
Wonderful battle! A learning experience.\xfffe...Thanks for the tip!
Our specialty is the best\xfffePokémon battles.
Welcome!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWould you like a cold drink\xfffewith your Pokémon battle?\xf000븁\x0000
That was a wonderful battle.\xfffeBravo!
Invigorating Soda Pop for exhausted\xfffePokémon after a battle!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAvailable in any vending machine!
Twist Mountain changes in every season,\xfffeand this old man changes in every battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Go easy on...\xfffea grown-up?!
This old man likes winter.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSnow on Twist Mountain...\xfffehas an indescribable beauty.
My Pokémon love the ore mined here,\xfffeand they love fiery Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
You got me!\xfffeMy Pokémon thinks so, too!
If Pokémon eat the ore inside a mountain,\xfffea hole grows, and our work speeds up!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePeople and Pokémon\xfffework great together!
The number two Trainer\xfffeon Twist Mountain is me!\xf000븁\x0000
From now on, you are the number two Trainer\xfffeon Twist Mountain.
From now on, I will be the\xfffenumber three Trainer on Twist Mountain.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor your information,\xfffethe number one is Clay!
What do you think about the cannons?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIsn't it great that you can\xfffeexperience how flying Pokémon feel?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNext, experience the feeling\xfffeof losing a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I was blown away!!
I'll be stronger if I fight\xfffewhile thinking about Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeVictory will come my way!
Trainer! I bet you're\xfffetoo blown away to fight!\xf000븁\x0000
What a calm person you are!\xfffeYou're amazing!
Cannons used once may be used again.\xfffeIt's recycling! Precisely!
In order to jump higher,\xfffeI am practicing really hard!\xf000븁\x0000
No problem! Even though I lost,\xfffeI will just prepare and jump again!
Trainer! Do you remember\xfffewhat you were told at the beginning?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe“The cannons go up, down,\xfffeleft, and right.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou can enter them from anywhere!"\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow about that?\xfffeI am good at imitating him, aren't I?
My plans are perfectly honed!\xfffeI cannot lose!\xf000븁\x0000
No way! What part of my fighting style\xfffedid I forget to double-check?
Check after check after check!\xfffeComplacency leads to accidents!
Battles in the Castelia Gym are\xfffebeautiful! They are pure art!!\xf000븁\x0000
Falling beautifully...\xfffeThis is also an art...
If you step on two switches, two lamps\xfffewill light up and a gate will open!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis is also an art!
I like the feeling of walking\xfffethrough the honey walls...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI've walked through them many times.\xf000븁\x0000
How is this possible?\xfffeI will walk through the honey walls again.
The honey walls...\xfffeWhat do you think they are made of?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't you think it is odd\xfffethat Burgh never tells us?
What do you think? This Pokémon Gym...\xfffeHow should I say? Isn't it full of...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeoutrageous and mysterious charms?\xf000븁\x0000
As a Trainer,\xfffeyou are full of charm!
I absolutely love this Gym where\xfffeBurgh's vision became reality!
I wasn't hiding under the floor\xfffejust to lose!
I was defeated by your strong spirit.\xfffeYou seem unfazed by anything!
OK, challenger!\xfffeBring it on!\xf000븁\x0000
But then, but...\xfffeI lost?!
Get on the elevators,\xfffeand go down and down!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA Trainer's spirit means\xfffetake it as far as you can!
When the elevator goes up,\xfffemy spirits rise!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen the elevator goes down,\xfffemy spirits fall...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you want to know why Clay\xfffeis at the bottom, defeat me!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost. There go my spirits...\xfffeaaaaaall the way down!
Clay is waiting\xfffeat the very bottom because...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffehe wants to remember\xfffethat he was at the bottom in the past.
I face my Pokémon,\xfffeand we share our real feelings.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSometimes that's what I do\xfffein this Pokémon Gym.\xf000븁\x0000
Right now, my Pokémon and I\xfffeboth feel the sting of defeat!
When we lose,\xfffeI apologize to my Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt is important for our future,\xfffeand it helps me grow strong!
Wow! You are so strong!\xfffeCongratulations!
Here's my lame excuse:\xfffeI lost because the ship was swaying!






I thought I could take it easy against you,\xfffebut got burned bad!
While I was staring at your pretty face,\xfffethe Pokémon battle was over.
You know so many rare Pokémon!\xfffeOr at least, your Pokémon are new to me.
I... I am not disappointed.\xfffeBecause I am elegant!
Dizzy...\xfffeSo very dizzzzzy...
Having traveled the world, I realized\xfffewe can communicate through our Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
That message came through loud and clear!
Having traveled around the world,\xfffeI learned that travel brings change!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe should not be afraid of change.
Countless feelings infuse these ruins!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's fun to imagine them!\xfffeAnd how are you feeling?\xf000븁\x0000
I am feeling...\xfffevery upset because I could not win!
People and Pokémon\xfffeeach have different feelings.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd probably both are correct.
Being with my Pokémon makes me happy\xfffeeven when we’re in a bad situation!\xf000븁\x0000
Yes! It was fun that your and my Pokémon\xfffewere both so energetic!
When I feel lonely at night,\xfffeI curl up with my Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand watch the twinkling stars.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI track the shooting stars\xfffeand slow down the rhythm of my life.
Whether I travel or not,\xfffeI want to make a great discovery.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! I may have discovered\xfffesomething good about you!
The world is full of mysteries!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I look closely.\xfffeThat's why I listen carefully.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think, I reflect, and\xfffeI discover something new.
The Abilities of my Pokémon!\xfffeI will show them to you.\xf000븁\x0000
I could not make really good use\xfffeof the Ability Mummy...
If an Ability is changed to Mummy,\xfffethe Pokémon cannot use its original\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAbility. It's subtly devious, isn't it?
Oh! That moment!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's when we use Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! Is it over already?
Oh! That moment.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's when you notice\xfffehow great Pokémon are!
I am a Psychic, so just one look at you\xfffetells me that you are a Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
I am a Psychic,\xfffeso I can tell the battle is over.
Sifting the ever-changing sands...\xfffeSifting my ever-changing feelings...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTelepathy means others will be aware of\xfffemy feelings. That could be a good thing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWait! It means others will be aware when\xfffeI have awkward or painful feelings, too!
Let me battle with you!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow...\xfffeYou are my strongest challenger so far.
Engage the switches and\xfffestart from the defined position.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you try all the combinations,\xfffesomeday you'll find the right one!
The problem is never\xfffewhether you can battle or not.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's whether you will battle or not.\xf000븁\x0000
If you don't fight, you won't lose,\xfffebut you won't grow stronger, either.
When you're not sure if you'll succeed,\xfffebuild momentum and take a leap!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's fine! Because your Pokémon\xfffeare always with you!
The slippery frozen floor is perfect\xfffefor improving your sense of balance!\xf000븁\x0000
I slipped and lost!
Brycen slides on the frozen floor\xfffeall the time, so it's worn down, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit looks like you can see the path...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut maybe I'm imagining it.
Well, well, if you are feeling dizzy\xfffebecause of the Gym machines,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will stand in your path!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, dear me!
Being fired into the air by cannons\xfffeand spinning on the ice many times...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's difficult to get Badges.
I always calm myself and choose\xfffethe critical moment in a battle.\xf000븁\x0000
Mmmm?! What?!\xfffeNo way? Really?!
Being calm and having no emotion\xfffeare different.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBrycen rejoices quietly,\xfffeand he grows quietly in rage...
I am the King of Karate!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI've taught my Pokémon moves\xfffethat they'll use in battle with you!\xf000븁\x0000
I am the King of Karate!!\xfffeI am skillful, but I lose quite often...
I am from a fighting dojo in Kanto!!\xfffeThis is my global debut, so to speak!
Oh! Trainer!\xfffeDo you want to learn a bitter lesson?\xf000븁\x0000
The training is over!
Going slowly is fine.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I train every single day,\xfffeI will be strong someday!
Are you looking for a Pokémon here,\xfffeor are you just taking a walk?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeEither way, have a battle with me!\xf000븁\x0000
What is it?\xfffeI can't explain it, but you are great!
Even if you forget about this battle,\xfffeI will never forget this!
Competitive eating\xfffeis one thing I'm good at!\xf000븁\x0000
What I am bad at\xfffeis Pokémon battles...
I am training here to improve my\xfffeweak points.
Beginnings are important, whether\xfffein a good novel or a good battle!
It seems this is the beginning\xfffeof my final chapter.
I feel we're about to turn the page\xfffeto the epilogue of this story.
Wow. I'm dumbstruck!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI know a lot of words, but right now I can't\xfffefigure out how to say this.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePerhaps, if the feeling I'm having now\xfffeis put into words, it will be trapped there.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo let me say this...\xfffeMy feeling is you're a great Trainer!
I never thought you would use that move...\xfffeNot a bad choice at all.
Good, good...\xfffeBut I will never retreat from any battle.
Even in this situation,\xfffethere must be a way to triumph!
If somebody wins a battle, then, without\xfffedoubt, someone else has lost the battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's the way of battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA real warrior doesn't dash off in pursuit\xfffeof the next victory, nor throw a fit\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhen experiencing a loss.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA real warrior ponders the next battle.
Oh, so strong.\xfffeThat makes my heart dance!
That's my final Pokémon!\xfffeSo we'll use our last bit of strength!
Well, this may be the last.\xfffeI will put everything into my next move!
There is no single strongest Pokémon\xfffeor sole best combination...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why it is difficult\xfffeto keep winning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever, I think a heart that desires\xfffestrength and strives to grow\xf000븀\x0000\xfffestronger is a precious ideal.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat is why I respect you--\xfffebecause you have these things.
I get the feeling a wonderful time\xfffeis about to start. I'm excited!
Even at a time like this,\xfffeI should stay cool and collected...
For the sake of the Pokémon\xfffethat believe in me, I will never give up.
As a Trainer, you are both excellent\xfffeand elegant. Your Pokémon have class.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am very pleased to have battled you.
Do you believe that Pokémon battles\xfffehelp us understand one another?
I will show you that my love for my friends\xfffepermeates every cell of my body. Behold!
My friends getting hurt...\xfffeThat's what a Pokémon battle is.
Agggghh.\xfffeEvery single time...
It's not fun to see\xfffemy friends in trouble.
Well, that's OK.\xfffeI was expecting this defeat.
Do you really think you can stop us\xfffewith that?
My last friend...\xfffePlease share your courage with me!
Is the world going to choose you--\xfffeand not me?!
Everything’s ruined. The truth I held...\xfffeThe dreams Pokémon shared...
I was expecting exactly that kind of move!
What is going on here?
My calculations... No! My careful schemes!\xfffeThe world should be mine!
I am a Doctor!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have Pokémon in bad shape...\xfffeLet me see your Pokémon in battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength is fathomless!\xfffeI am deeply impressed.
Whether your Pokémon are healthy\xfffeor not, I'll restore them to full health!\xf000븁\x0000
I aim to be the best Doctor in the world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut first, I intend to become\xfffethe best Trainer in the world!
An Ace Trainer like me has pride,\xfffeso I won't lose!\xf000븁\x0000
I could not protect my pride.\xfffeI'm mortified!
Pride does not mean acting arrogantly!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm really proud of what\xfffeI have achieved in my life!
I've thought about what I can do\xfffeto help my Pokémon win, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefinally I figured out the answer!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm afraid I could not read\xfffewhat you wanted to do...
Read what your opponent wants to do.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour opponent is human and may change\xfffeplans from moment to moment. Be careful!
Before going to the Pokémon League,\xfffelet me test my skills!\xf000븁\x0000
It's obvious, but there is always\xfffesomeone better...
The Elite Four are said to be\xfffewaiting at the Pokémon League.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI wonder what kind of people they are.
Oh, boy...\xfffeMy Pokémon want to brag about me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, let's start!\xf000븁\x0000
Ouch!\xfffeThey can't brag about me.
Because I respect my opponents,\xfffeI want to win against them!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I want other people to think\xfffethey want to win against me!
Whenever I am lost, I meet a Trainer!\xfffeOf course, we're gonna fight!\xf000븁\x0000
Mmmmm... It's not good\xfffeto fight when I am lost.
When people move ahead,\xfffethey get lost, or they stop...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAt those moments, Pokémon give you\xfffecourage to keep moving forward!
The people who pass by here\xfffehave such different moods!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's fun to watch, and even more fun\xfffeto fight against them!\xf000븁\x0000
Mwa haha!\xfffeIt's fun!
Winning is good,\xfffebut winning is not everything...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDon't lose sight of what's important!
Wait! \xfffeYou, young Trainer over there!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLook at my Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Not bad!\xfffeI like your strength.
As a Pokémon grows, its connection\xfffeto its Trainer will improve,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand their bond becomes stronger!
If there is a steep cave in the east,\xfffeI go there and train my Pokémon, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeif there is a strong Trainer in the west,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI go there and challenge that Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
My Pokémon clearly lack\xfffeproper training!!
Pokémon training Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf they live in rugged wilderness,\xfffethat can happen naturally.
Oh, are you the legendary Pokémon\xfffethat is said to live here?\xf000븁\x0000
You startled me.\xfffeYou are a person!
In the story I know,\xfffethe legendary Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewas training its student Pokémon.
These Pokémon were born\xfffeon the same day and raised together!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh!\xfffeYou're pretty good!
Our days with Pokémon\xfffeare full of happiness, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeour joys will grow as we live together!
Please tell me what kinds of Pokémon are\xfffeby your side and share your happiness\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhen you are happy!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow!\xfffeWonderful!
When I've been happy or sad,\xfffethe Pokémon have always been with me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI hope I can stay with them\xfffeas long as possible.
Celestial Tower means a perfect tower!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, never mind.\xfffeLet's have a Pokémon battle.\xf000븁\x0000
You're really perfect!
I am far from perfect...
Pokémon that grew up in Unova and\xfffePokémon that grew up elsewhere--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeboth rest here quietly.\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are full of life!
Pokémon that grew up in Unova and\xfffePokémon that grew up elsewhere--\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeall are precious Pokémon...
I will guess what you are...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou are...\xfffea Pokémon Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
What was that?\xfffeI guessed what you were, though.
Everyone can make the effort\xfffeto understand their opponent.
The Dragon Gym in Opelucid City\xfffeis where tough Trainers show\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethey can carve out their own path!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm sure you can carve out\xfffeyour own path!
As the name suggests,\xfffea Gym Leader is the top of a Gym!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Leader is top of the heap\xfffeat this Opelucid Gym!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you want to meet the Leader,\xfffeclimb up on the dragons' backs\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand aim for the top floor!
Do you understand\xfffehow the dragons' heads move?\xf000븁\x0000
You're strong! I guess you want to know\xfffeabout the dragons' heads pretty badly.
The dragons' arms go up and down...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd depending on the arms,\xfffethe dragons' heads turn right and left\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand move up and down, too.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeListen! Here is a hint!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf both arms point down,\xfffethe dragon's head sinks down, too.
I will test you to see how well\xfffeyou really know Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
You are bringing out your Pokémon's\xfffefull potential!
I am a Trainer. \xfffeI don't have to get strong myself.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll I have to do is to support Pokémon\xfffeso that they can fight at their best.
By any chance,\xfffeare you unsure of what to do?\xf000븁\x0000
What is this?\xfffeI felt your confidence.
The dragons in this Gym\xfffecan be elevators, too!
I will tell a Trainer who beats me\xfffehow to move forward in this Gym!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! \xfffeYou beat me!
Jump from a triangle mark!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen you land on a switch on an arm,\xfffethe dragon's head will move,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand you can move ahead!
Are you happy just hanging out\xfffewith Pokémon?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeOr do they have to be strong?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWe'll see which type you are!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon seem to be happy\xfffejust hanging around with you!
Every person loves Pokémon\xfffein a different way.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGetting strong with my Pokémon...\xfffeThat's the way I chose.
I wonder what you will do\xfffeas a Trainer?!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, you fight very well.\xfffeYou are great!
I love Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI never know what my opponent will do.\xfffeIt gives me chills!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWin or lose, it's the excitement\xfffeof the fight that counts!
My favorite word is “challenge"!\xfffeDo you like challenges?\xf000븁\x0000
You seem to like challenges!
Do you like challenges...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you take a challenge,\xfffeyou can find something good.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you don't try anything, you just\xfffemake excuses.
Argh...\xfffeMy heart aches!
We have ten years' experience battling!\xfffeI give you a taste of a Veteran's skill!\xf000븁\x0000
I guess the time spent\xfffeis not everything!
Getting stronger...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeis like walking down a road\xfffethat never ends,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeno matter how much you fight...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's what this Dragon Gym is about.\xfffeIt's the secret of the dragons' backs...
I've heard about you.\xfffeI heard you work Pokémon hard!\xf000븁\x0000
Yes, I heard you are strong.\xfffeYou match what I heard exactly.
To get to a lower level, stand still\xfffein the midst of quicksand.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm not being kind...\xfffeMy companions will defeat you.
You!\xfffeTo please my Pokémon, lose!\xf000븁\x0000
What a Trainer!
Because of you,\xfffemy Pokémon lost!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDon't you feel sorry for them?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBesides, you are just depending\xfffeon your Pokémon for strength.
If everyone frees their Pokémon,\xfffethere is no winning or losing!\xf000븁\x0000
If I don't have Pokémon,\xfffeI won't lose like this!
How dare you interrupt us\xfffewithout understanding us?
We fight for the young king...\xfffeThat's it!\xf000븁\x0000
My king...\xfffeI am so sorry.
Everything changes.\xfffeUnova will also be born again.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhy don't you admit that?
You can't change the world\xfffewithout a little pain!\xf000븁\x0000
Ouch...\xfffeI don't like pain.
We're trying so hard to change the world\xfffebecause nobody else is trying. Yet...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's right! You! Can you understand\xfffeour lord N's feelings?
Pokémon are too good for the likes of\xfffeyou! They are amazing, but putting them\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein the hands of foolish Trainers can bring\xf000븀\x0000\xfffenothing good!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh!\xfffeAnnoying!
Me, lose? Here I am, covered in sand,\xfffethrowing everything I have into it,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand I lose? Am I that much of a loser?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt should be your loss.\xfffeAnd that's an order!
I won't tolerate people\xfffewho have different ideas!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh...\xfffeI won't forgive you!
I repeat! We won't tolerate people\xfffewho have different ideas!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour friends are waiting below--\xfffenow get out!
When I am surrounded by rocks,\xfffemy spirit goes up!!\xf000븁\x0000
When I lose,\xfffemy spirits sink...
My spirits rise and fall.\xfffeI'm just charmingly unpredictable!
Why do I dig?\xfffeWhy do you fight?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's find out.\xf000븁\x0000
Your past experience...\xfffeIs that the source of your strength?
The more you fight,  \xfffethe stronger you'll be.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe more you dig, \xfffethe bigger the hole will be...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have a purpose, \xfffethere's no wasted effort!
At work, we do our best.\xfffeThat is my, and my Pokémon's, way of life!\xf000븁\x0000
We did our best,\xfffeand this is the result?!
Well, well, I guess I'll go back to work.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe'Cause my precious Pokémon\xfffeare better at work.
My favorite things are:\xfffeMountains! Meals! Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd fun battles!!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, ho ho!\xfffeYou got me!
Your team is so strong!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut my Pokémon were also\xfffequite good, weren't they?
I'm chasing my dream,\xfffeand I'm fighting for a victory!\xf000븁\x0000
I can't catch that dream!
I am looking for a legendary Pokémon\xfffesaid to be hiding in this cave.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYes, it's true. Men are suckers for\xfffeadventure, no matter how old we get!
This cave is full of rocks\xfffegenerating electricity!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThe electricity is charging me up!\xf000븁\x0000
Yowch, a lightning spark!
The sources of my energy are\xfffemy precious Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis has been scientifically proven!!
I will research and investigate\xfffeyour Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I must analyze my defeat...
Why don't you go discover\xfffesomething else?
I will unlock the mechanism\xfffeand find the secret of your power!\xf000븁\x0000
I was so preoccupied with the mechanism,\xfffeI forgot to concentrate on the battle!
The mechanism of rain, and\xfffethe science of changing seasons...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNature is full of wonders.
I see.\xfffeI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\xfffeIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
I see.\xfffeI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\xfffeIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
I see.\xfffeI'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...\xfffeIt's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
Plasmaaaa!\xfffeWahhhhh!
Long live Team Plasma!
For every great plan, there\xfffeis someone to get in the way.
Have you learned your lesson now?\xfffe...I'm such a sore loser.
Plasmaaaa!\xfffeAhh, our beautiful dream...
Plasmaaaa!\xfffeThis is a nightmare!
Whoa, whoa, come on now!\xfffeI'm shocked to lose against a little kid!
It's best to use what you have learned\xfffein order to master it!\xf000븁\x0000
What can you learn by losing?\xfffeI feel like there's a “Eureka!" here for me.
I'm mastering the lesson in three\xfffedimensions by experiencing it like this!
Come on! \xfffeYou're just a kid--a kid on an ego trip!
Our rules and your rules\xfffeare different!
Plasmaaaa! If this keeps up,\xfffewe won't save the Pokémon!
My hunch is you're sabotaging us because\xfffeyou're flat-out jealous of our cool outfits.
You seem to understand the importance\xfffeof the first attack very well.
If I can bring out the power of my Pokémon,\xfffeI can still pull this off and win.
Impressive.\xfffeBut why can't I win?!

You seem to understand the importance\xfffeof the first attack very well.
If I can bring out the power of my Pokémon,\xfffeI can still pull this off and win.
Impressive.\xfffeBut why can't I win?!
Well, at a time like this,\xfffelet's have a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I see. \xfffeWas that your favorite Pokémon?
Wherever I go in the world,\xfffeI have Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnce I ask about someone's favorite\xfffePokémon, we soon become friends!
My way of life is dynamic!\xf000븁\x0000
My way of losing is\xfffealso dynamic!
My Pokémon are always with me!\xfffeThat's why I can be dynamic!

...What?
Pah, is that it?\xfffeI lost before I knew it...
Oh, hee hee hee...\xfffeYou're so strong.
Pant, pant, pant, pant...



The ideal movement of living things,\xfffesuch pure beauty!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAh, let me behold them!\xf000븁\x0000
I saw their beauty up close!
You know, creatures that exert \xfffeall their strength are always beautiful.
If you win against me,\xfffeI will give you something good\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefrom this backpack!\xf000븁\x0000
You are great!\xfffeAnd strong!
Here you are.\xfffeI will give you this as I promised!\xf000븁\x0000
It feels great to run as fast as you can\xfffeover mountains and through forests.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeRight?
I came here on my journey,\xfffebut it's kind of lively here, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000
Is there a festival or something \xfffegoing on here?
This is what I found during my trip.\xfffeI don't need it, so I will give it to you.\xf000븁\x0000
Everybody is dressed the same way.\xfffeIs this some kind of ceremony?
I bet athletes are not satisfied\xfffewith their games.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's how I feel\xfffewhen I watch them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe reason? If you win against me,\xfffeI will tell you why!\xf000븁\x0000
Are you pleased with your victory?\xfffeOr are you unsatisfied?
This Moomoo Milk is tasty\xfffeand so very satisfying!\xf000븁\x0000
No matter how great their play is,\xfffethere is always a greater play.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am never satisfied with my bread,\xfffeeven though I bake it very well.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI always want to make the next\xfffeloaf even more delicious!
A place where you can warm up!\xfffeThat's what I heard and why I came here!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's turn up the heat on this thing!\xf000븁\x0000
The heat here is too much.\xfffeI'm just burning up!
My warrior's heart is burning!\xfffeThank you for the hot battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNext, I will stay on this hot streak\xfffeand watch the game!
To raise healthy Pokémon, you need\xfffeto keep their minds and bodies active,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewatching games and having battles!\xf000븁\x0000
It's so frustrating to lose!\xfffeBut it's also important to learn from it.
You learn more when you lose\xfffethan when you win!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI think it's the same for sports, too.
The Pokémon I raised are\xfffeas good as professionals!\xf000븁\x0000
The Pokémon you raised\xfffeare great, too!
There are so many ways\xfffeto raise Pokémon.
I am not skipping work!\xf000븁\x0000
If I had known this would happen,\xfffeI would have worked diligently.
Taking a productive break\xfffeis also part of any job!
Someone sent me a ticket, so I came.\xfffeBut there's no game going on!\xf000븁\x0000
I have a lot of work to do.\xfffeWhat am I doing here?
Athletes on off days are no better\xfffethan guys on days off.
I wonder if there are great children\xfffewho will become stars someday\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewho are now just kids at my preschool.\xf000븁\x0000
You are also quite brilliant, but\xfffereal stars are cool.
You seem to have potential as a star.\xfffeSo, will you please be my friend?\xf000븁\x0000
Should I get autographs now\xfffefrom children who are likely to be stars?
I love sports and Pokémon most of all.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow about a battle?\xfffeThey used to call me the Cleaner!\xf000븁\x0000
I could not stop all\xfffeof your Pokémon's attacks...
I used to be a Striker.\xfffeI was responsible for scoring goals.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow I am a sweeper.\xfffeI am responsible for sweeping floors.
The athletes' Pokémon are great!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut my Pokémon are also great!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are also great!
I will strive to raise my Pokémon\xfffeto that level!
Did you see today's game?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere was some great ball handling\xfffeby players and Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe excitement is pumping me up\xfffefor a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, but I am still excited!
The only place you can watch Pokémon\xfffeenjoying sports is Nimbasa City!
When I come here, I get hyper!\xfffeSo, let's have a battle right away!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost against you too quickly!
When I am watching a game, I get hyper!\xfffeI just can't sit still!
Doctor! Is there a Doctor\xfffein the audience?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYes, I am a Doctor.\xfffeLet's get into a battle.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! My Pokémon is all worn out!
When Pokémon lose energy, Max Revive!\xfffeYou should also take one with you.\xf000븁\x0000
When I am watching a game,\xfffeI just keep worrying about\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhether an athlete will be injured.
You chose to speak to me from\xfffeamong so many people!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYou have a good eye!\xf000븁\x0000
You are a worthy opponent!
The way you use moves...\xfffeQuite honestly, I like it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHere, this is for you!\xf000븁\x0000
Heehee.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven when I am in the crowd,\xfffepeople can tell I am strong.
I usually act like an Ace Trainer,\xfffebut I want to be an ordinary girl,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeat least when I am here.\xf000븁\x0000
I don't want to think about Pokémon\xfffevery much right now!
If I give you this,\xfffewill you leave me alone?\xf000븁\x0000
Even as an Ace Trainer, sometimes\xfffeI just want to be an ordinary girl!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI want to scream for the cool athletes,\xfffeand enjoy my time.
Which team will score next?!\xfffeIf you can win, I will tell you!\xf000븁\x0000
Aha!\xfffeThat team will score next!
My psychic power only works\xffferight before a player scores a point.
Heheh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe team I want to win\xfffealways wins!\xf000븁\x0000
What...? Was everything up till now\xfffejust a coincidence...?
Feelings matter when you cheer!\xfffeIf I believe, I feel my team will win!
Fishing is a perfectly respectable sport!\xfffeWhy isn't there a fishing stadium?!\xf000븁\x0000
...Of course, fishing is fun\xfffewhen you enjoy it in nature.\xf000븁\x0000
I like quiet nature,\xfffebut I like lively places like this, too.
A lot of sports started\xfffeas Gentlemen's games!\xf000븁\x0000
Ladies and Gentlemen!\xfffeThe game is over!
Because I am a Gentleman,\xfffeI will present you with this gift.\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon battles were born spontaneously\xfffewhen people and Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffefirst became friendly.
Hey, hey, did you see that? Awesome!\xfffeA lot of famous people from TV are here!\xf000븁\x0000
Athletes are all coooool.\xfffeI want to be like them.
Aghhhhh. Why didn't I bring a camera,\xfffeor a notebook for an autograph?
Sports and juggling are the same.\xfffeYou must entertain the audience!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will show you the fruits of my practice.\xf000븁\x0000
While I am having a Pokémon battle,\xfffeI catch ten balls!
I have mastered the technique,\xfffebut I cannot use it!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI just have to have real battles!
That incredibly flashy dorm,\xfffeand squealing cheerleaders all around...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGrrr...\xfffeI am envious!\xf000븁\x0000
What is so great about popular athletes?\xfffeWhat is bad about martial artists?
A run-down dojo, and a lot of shouts like\xfffehai-ya and kee-up...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I had known this before, I would have\xfffebeen a different kind of athlete.
When I grow up,\xfffeI will be a pro athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
Waaaaah!\xfffeI will never give you my autograph!
I will practice my autograph\xfffefor when I go pro!
My daddy is\xfffean athlete here!\xf000븁\x0000
Waaaaaah. Dadddddddy.
...I won't cry.\xfffe'Cause I promised my daddy.
Even Socialites enjoy sports,\xfffein a very elegant way!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA Pokémon battle is\xfffea sport in a way!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's fight elegantly!\xf000븁\x0000
O-ho-ho!\xfffeI lost so elegantly.
Oh dear, I mistook this for a ball\xfffeand ordered it. Now it's yours.\xf000븁\x0000
First of all, we should enjoy\xfffesports and Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you get hung up on winning and losing,\xfffeyou lose sight of what is most valuable.
I will be strong in Pokémon battles,\xfffeand I will marry a professional athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah.\xfffeI still have a long way to go!
Your Pokémon are strong. I will give\xfffesomething good to a strong person!\xf000븁\x0000
Strong people are always totally\xfffeattractive. Don't you think?
A Hiker, an athlete,\xfffeand a Pokémon Trainer.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeDo you know what is important?\xf000븁\x0000
Grrrrrrr!\xfffeClearly you know it!
Prepare thoroughly. \xfffeIf you don't, you can't do anything!
I can't believe nobody has noticed me...\xfffeI am a star!\xf000븁\x0000
Don't look at me. I lost!
Whose autograph do you want?\xfffeDon't you want one of mine?
You are energetic!\xfffeI will punish lazy children!\xf000븁\x0000
You just don't quit!\xfffeYou are so energetic!
OK! An energetic Trainer!\xfffeTake this!\xf000븁\x0000
Nurses need plenty of stamina,\xfffeboth day and night!
My darling is working here.\xfffeHow about that? Are you envious?\xf000븁\x0000
My darling is seriously the best.\xfffeHe puts athletes to shame.
My darling is a Janitor!\xfffeHe cleans this entire big place\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby himself every day. Cool, huh?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNobody else can do what he does.
Games in the rain look extra tough,\xfffedon't they?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder what Pokémon battles\xfffein rain are like.\xf000븁\x0000
Well, this place is indoors,\xfffeso they don't get rained out.
If a stadium has a roof, \xfffethey can play a game anytime!
Hey! It's me! It's me!\xfffeI am the best Pilot in Unova!\xf000븁\x0000
You! You are daring!\xfffeBe my apprentice!
A once-in-a-lifetime flight!\xfffeFly, fly, and fly away!
Do you want to know\xfffehow the VIP seats are?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will tell you\xfffeif you win against me!\xf000븁\x0000
VIP seats are very far away\xfffefrom the athletes!
I could see the game fine, but\xfffethe athletes looked like grains of rice.
You!\xfffeYou are a fan of that person.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI can tell!\xfffeBut that person is mine!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh no, oh why?\xfffeI am sorry...
Come to think of it,\xfffethe more supporters there are,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe better.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou! Cheer until you lose your voice,\xfffeand clap until your hands fall off!
When I am watching a game,\xfffeI feel like I should be moving, too!\xf000븁\x0000
That was a good workout!
The dorm is fine, but I want to play\xfffesports outdoors.
I want to drag people here\xfffeand have them enlist as Pokémon Rangers.\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Electrifying!\xfffeYou are so goooood!
You! Be a Pokémon Ranger!\xfffeI will give you a good workout!
Watch a game during a study break!\xfffeHave a battle during a game break!\xf000븁\x0000
Gah!\xfffeThis is so not relaxing!
When I come here for fun,\xfffeI can study more efficiently!
OK, I decided!\xfffeIf I win against you,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will be a Gym Leader!\xf000븁\x0000
Ummmm...\xfffeMaybe I'm not ready to be a Gym Leader?
I have to consider what I will be\xfffeby trying a lot of things!
I wonder if being good at sports\xfffeand being good at battles are related?\xf000븁\x0000
It was very helpful...
Ummmm. You are\xfffequite interesting.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease have this!\xf000븁\x0000
Both sports and Pokémon are\xfffelike a science for me!
I am stuck inside the lab,\xfffewith a medicinal smell every day,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand then I get stressed out.\xf000븁\x0000
Waaaaaahhh! Frustrating!
Breaking out made me feel better!\xfffeHere's a token of my appreciation.\xf000븁\x0000
Let's have another Pokémon battle\xfffesometime, so we won't be stressed out!
These are not shorts!\xfffeThese are half pants!\xf000븁\x0000
You were so strong that\xfffemy half pants almost fell down!
You are awesome!\xfffeHere's an awesome gift for you!\xf000븁\x0000
I envy basketball players.\xfffe'Cause they wear shorts, not half pants.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut baseball and football\xfffeuniforms are also cool!
Mmm!\xfffeYou smell like an athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
I see. That is the smell\xfffethat strong people give off...
You seem to be getting even stronger...\xfffeOK. Please take this.\xf000븁\x0000
I hope you will get even stronger\xfffeby using it.
Wow, you have a lot of Badges.\xfffeLet me see your skills!\xf000븁\x0000
That fighting style reminds me\xfffeof the old days!
A person like you should use\xfffetop-shelf items--like this!\xf000븁\x0000
No matter how old we get,\xfffelet's stay Trainers!
Cheering makes us\xfffethirsty. Right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you can win against me,\xfffeI'll give you a drink!\xf000븁\x0000
The battle made me\xfffeeven thirstier!
Here you are.\xfffeI will give you something good!\xf000븁\x0000
At a place like this,\xfffeit's good to drink a lot of water!
Cheering makes us\xfffethirsty. Right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you can win against me,\xfffeI'll give you a drink!\xf000븁\x0000
The battle made me\xfffeeven thirstier!
Here you are.\xfffeI will give you something good!\xf000븁\x0000
At a place like this,\xfffeit's good to drink a lot of water!
Let's have a battle on these grounds,\xfffewhich I keep looking sharp!\xf000븁\x0000
The best battle\xfffeon the best ground!
OK! I will keep the grounds\xfffelooking perfect!
This air of excitement brings back\xfffememories. In those days, I was also...\xf000븁\x0000
It makes my old wound ache...
I may not look like it,\xfffebut I used to be quite an athlete.
Are you a criminal?!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, you are not a criminal...\xfffeSorry! Lo siento!
I'm here because I heard someone\xfffearound here was faking points.
What? A battle at a place like this?\xfffeWait! Everybody is watching us!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, thanks to you, \xfffeI overcame my stage fright.
What? Nobody is watching me?\xfffeNooooo. Look at me, please!
I want you to tell me something!\xf000븁\x0000
You showed me your full strength!
I will work at the Battle Subway\xfffefrom now on, but...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewhere is it?
I want to play tennis\xfffelike a strong athlete!\xf000븁\x0000
Joe: A no-point game\xfffeagainst you 'cause you're strong...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRoss: A no-point game\xfffe'cause we could not win at all!
I want to be as good a Cyclist\xfffeas a strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeThen, we cannot have a battle.
I want to play ball\xfffelike a strong athlete!\xf000븁\x0000

I want to learn more from\xfffea strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?\xfffeI prefer a doubles match.
Whoosh! Whoosh!\xfffeI can fight like that!\xf000븁\x0000
Joe: Fffffft...\xfffeFffffft, fffffft... The ball needs air.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRoss: Faaaault!\xfffeI missed a serve!
They can keep moving\xfffefor such a long time.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSmashers are really great!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
Hah!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDid you see my power serve?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd my Pokémon is\xfffeeven stronger!\xf000븁\x0000

The person who controls his serves\xfffecontrols the game.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will practice my serves a bit more.
Hah!
I love to watch professionals play!\xfffeYaaaay! I won't lose, either!\xf000븁\x0000
Ai: What?\xfffeDid we lose...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCiel: Ouch... I knew watching a game and\xfffeplaying it are different!
Watching a professional game\xfffemakes me strangely confident!
Exciting!
I want to move elegantly, too!\xfffeHey! Have a battle with me!\xf000븁\x0000

When professionals are playing,\xfffeit looks so easy...
Thrilling!
Oh!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAthletes are looking over this way!\xfffeLet's have a battle to impress them.\xf000븁\x0000
Masa: Agghhh!\xfffeWe showed them an embarrassing scene.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYas: Hurrah! Hurrah!\xfffeMy Pokémon! What...?
I thought they were looking at us, but\xfffethey were looking at their opponents...
Is that athlete looking at me?\xfffeNo, he's not.
If I win in a Pokémon battle,\xfffecheer for this team.\xf000븁\x0000

I lost, so I will cheer for you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHurray! Hurray! Go you go!\xfffeHustle! Hustle! Go you go!
Ummmm. The cheering for this team\xfffeis not nearly loud enough...
Look at this buff body!\xfffeAnd the Pokémon that support it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's have a Pokémon battle\xfffeto show off my greatness!\xf000븁\x0000
Masa: The greatness of basketball...\xfffeI think you got it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYas: Shall we curl up \xfffelike balls?
The important thing in basketball\xfffeis outstanding teamwork!
Hmph! Hmph!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFirst-class athletes \xfffespeak with their backs.
The way the athletes scramble\xfffefor that ball...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wish they'd fight over me that way!\xf000븁\x0000

From the ball's point of view,\xfffeit's like, please don't fight over me!
The way the athletes scramble\xfffefor that ball...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wish they'd fight over me that way!
If you win, I will tell you\xfffewhy I like basketball!\xf000븁\x0000
Kat: Come on!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePhae: Look! Even though we lost, \xfffethe ball is still spinning!
When you are watching basketball,\xfffeit reminds you of fruit in a basket,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand it looks delicious. Right?
Basketball... No, no. For a battle, \xfffeyou need to have two Pokémon.
My special skill is that I can\xfffespin a ball on my finger.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI can spin it forever!\xf000븁\x0000

I want to have Poké Balls\xfffewith the same designs as\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe balls used in sports!
Basketball... No, no. For a battle,\xfffeyou need to have two Pokémon.
Look!\xfffeMy defense is magnificent!\xf000븁\x0000
Hawk: It's strange. When professionals\xfffeare playing, it looks so easy...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDar: I guess we cannot play\xfffequite as well as the professionals...
Rock-solid defense!\xfffeThat's a real thrill in football!
DE-fense! DE-fense!
Look!\xfffeMy magnificent offense!\xf000븁\x0000

Offense that smashes in every direction!\xfffeThat's a real thrill in football!
Offffffense!
The bond of football fans\xfffeis stronger than any tackle!\xf000븁\x0000
Hawk: The bond between you and\xfffeyour Pokémon is strong, too!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDar: This feeling will go well past\xfffethe goal line...
Football is knockdown amazing,\xfffebecause you can feel the excitement,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe bond between players and the crowd!
Our bond as fans\xfffeis way stronger than this!
My cheer will go over the goal line\xfffeand will be heard for a million miles!\xf000븁\x0000

When I cheer for my team\xfffeuntil I get thirsty,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeFresh Water tastes even better!
Come on! Cheer louder!\xfffeYell! Yell!
I mainly play on offense.\xfffeMy friend is mainly defense.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will show you the teamwork\xfffeof football fans!\xf000븁\x0000
Cam: The teamwork of your Pokémon\xfffeis outstanding!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAbby: I'm super impressed!
If what you want to do is different\xfffefrom what your partner wants to do,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit's hard to win a Double Battle!
You know, football is a team sport!\xfffePlease prepare at least two Pokémon!
Double Battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is the best way to feel\xfffethe heat of the game of football!\xf000븁\x0000

The right play can turn a game around...\xfffePokémon battles are the same, too!
Double Battles!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need at least two Pokémon\xfffeto feel the heat of the game of football!
Boom-boom-badum! Ha! Boom-boom-badum!\xfffeListen to the fans' drumbeat!\xf000븁\x0000
Les: Thank you for listening to the beat\xfffeof our spirit!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWeb: Thank you for listening to the yell\xfffeof our spirit!
Ha, pan-pan-papan, hey-hoo!!\xfffeNext, we will use this rhythm!
Bam-bam-bam! Ha! Bam-bam-bam!\xfffeI see the end coming?
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo Ta-raaa!\xfffeListen to the fans shout!\xf000븁\x0000

Pan, pan-papan, hey-oo!! Right?\xfffeOh, the rhythm is wonderful!
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo ta-raaa!\xfffeListen to the fans shout!
Olé, olé, oléeee!\xfffeThis is the fan song I wrote!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Pokémon listening to this song\xfffetry harder than usual!\xf000븁\x0000
Kay: Olé, olé...\xfffeHuh? It's over.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAli: You are very strong!
“Olé!" means\xfffe“Go!" or “Move forward!"
Olé, olé, oléeee!\xfffeI am cheering now!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have two Pokémon,\xfffeI don't mind battling with you!
My friend came here with me...\xfffeShe comes 'cause she wants to sing\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemore than cheering for the team.\xf000븁\x0000

I am a fan of all the players\xfffewho are doing their best!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo, I want both teams to win!
With only one Pokémon,\xfffeit's a bit hard to battle.
Hey, you!\xfffeDo you know what offside means?\xf000븁\x0000
Kay: What we just saw is offside!\xfffeI bet it's offside!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAli: B... Baaaaah!\xfffeI won't tell you anymore!
What? What is offside?\xfffeEr... The girl next to me knows!
Off!
Hey, shall I tell you\xfffeabout the offside penalty?\xf000븁\x0000

Offside is when...\xfffeEr... The girl next to me will explain!
Side!
The bases loaded with two outs\xfffein the bottom of the ninth inning...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAfter that... Isn't that obvious?\xf000븁\x0000
Alf: Strike!\xfffeGame over! Yes, the end!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFred: Ah, my Poké Ball!
A game-winning homer...\xfffeWe always hope for that clutch play!
Striiiiike!!
I don't have a home-run ball,\xfffebut I do have a Poké Ball!\xf000븁\x0000

I wish I could catch a home-run ball\xfffejust once!
Ball!
Hit a home run!\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: We're slammed.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEira: I'm going home.
Elesa's fashion sense\xfffeis funky, too.
A one-on-two battle is\xfffetoo funky!
Hey, what does “long ball" mean?\xf000븁\x0000

What I heard is\xfffeit means a home run.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe“Homer" also\xfffemeans a home run!
We two battle together, so\xfffeyou need two Pokémon!
Hey, you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't smile at my favorite player.\xf000븁\x0000
Ami: Argh! We lost,\xfffeand it's your fault.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEira: You should try harder.\xfffeDon't drag me down.
The only thing we have in common\xfffeis that we like the same team.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut really, isn't that the most\xfffeimportant thing for a fan?
Argh, because of you, \xfffewe're in a big pinch.
Argh, annoying!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's none of your business\xfffewho I cheer for.\xf000븁\x0000

Our teamwork is sooooo bad,\xfffeexcept when we cheer during games.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut we really don't care\xfffeabout any time but game time.
No way! Argh, we are losing\xfffebecause you are not really trying!
I am quite strong.\xfffeI will work out today, too!\xf000븁\x0000
I... I got worked over.
Your strength!\xfffeYou pack quite a punch!
POWER!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you have power that nobody can beat,\xfffeyou can win both Pokémon battles\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand football games!\xf000븁\x0000
I...still don't have enough power?
Mmmm... Maybe I should\xfffetrain more...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\xfffeare my real friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeJoin the training of\xfffeour Pokémon Eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I am still such a rookie!\xfffeBut I have more guts than anybody else!
My Pokémon and I still haven't\xfffepracticed enough...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTo put it in levels, we're maybe a ten...
I am stronger than ever.\xfffeI will work out today, too!!\xf000븁\x0000
I got worked over.
A swing and a miss...\xfffeI can't keep up with your strength!
POWER!!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWith my ripped muscles,\xfffeI will overcome everything!\xf000븁\x0000
I still don't have\xfffeenough muscles...?!
Maybe I should change\xfffemy training regimen...
Pokémon and Poké Balls\xfffeare my real friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease join the training of\xfffeour Pokémon Eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I'm still such a rookie!\xfffeI have more than enough guts, though!
My Pokémon and I\xfffestill haven't practiced enough...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTo put it in levels, we're about a 20...
I am the strongest.\xfffeI will work out today, too!!\xf000븁\x0000
I...got worked over!
Your strength is\xfffehome-run class!
POWER!!!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will win! My superior power\xfffecan blaze any trail!\xf000븁\x0000
Is it possible that just having power\xfffeis not enough...?
Football games and Pokémon battles\xfffeboth require power and technique.
Pokémon and Poké Balls\xfffeare my real friends!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease join the training of\xfffeour Pokémon Eleven!\xf000븁\x0000
Aghhhhh! I am such a rookie!\xfffeI've got more guts, though!
My Pokémon and I still\xfffehaven't practiced enough...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTo put it in levels, we're maybe a 50...
I've practiced and practiced\xfffeand become a great player!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNow, let's play ball!\xf000븁\x0000
Game over!
Now, practice, practice, practice!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePracticing over and over is the best way\xfffeto be good at anything!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy hard work will make me a great player!
Kids! Please cooperate with the\xfffespecial training for my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
My block was supposed to guard\xfffeagainst even Steel-type Pokémon...
Physical therapy is over,\xfffeso we're doing some special training.
Let me tell you about the strength\xfffeof the team you create when\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou put a strong Pokémon at the core.\xf000븁\x0000
...You taught me!\xfffeYou are great!
It looks like a team built around\xfffea strong Pokémon. That is, an ace\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehas advantages and disadvantages.
Together, my Pokémon and I\xfffeare the world's strongest!!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! I didn't think anyone could\xfffecatch my blazing fastball!
My fastballs are so fast,\xfffenobody can hit them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeVery few can catch my fastballs\xfffeexcept Pokémon.
I, I...\xfffeI'm not fat, am I?\xf000븁\x0000
Ripped!
I am ripped!\xfffeI am not fat.
I have great footwork with the ball.\xfffePoké Balls, too. See?\xf000븁\x0000
After I let Pokémon out of\xfffePoké Balls... Well, I am still practicing...
I should practice more\xfffeon Pokémon handling, too.
I play occasionally,\xfffebut I want to become a better player!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo I will fight\xfffea lot of Pokémon battles, too!\xf000븁\x0000
UGHH!\xfffeI couldn't even pass the ball!
I will do anything to play better!\xfffeIt's over if you get complacent!
An elegant Smasher\xfffehas an elegant battle!\xf000븁\x0000
E-e-e-even though I lost,\xfffeI will not panic.
Because I am a lady, I won't be,\xfffewell, you know,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffech-ch-chagrined at losing.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWell, maybe a teensy little bit.
I am in the starting lineup now,\xfffebut I will be even better soon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will practice with a lot\xfffeof Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
UGHH!\xfffeMy field positioning was terrible!
If I think about why I made a mistake\xfffeand correct it, I'll make fewer mistakes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd if I work to improve my strength,\xfffeI'll get even stronger!
As a proper lady, I am elegant\xfffeall the way down to my toes!\xf000븁\x0000
Wahhhhh! What is this??
Oh! I am a lady,\xfffeyet I have lost my nerve...
I've always played games,\xfffebut now I want to be the best player!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will practice with a lot of\xfffePokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
UGHH! I missed the goal!\xfffeI was blocked!!
I won't give up games!\xfffeI won't accept limits!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNobody can stop me\xfffeas long as I want to improve!
I am a lady. I will challenge others\xfffeto battle elegantly!\xf000븁\x0000
You should...\xfffeGo easy on me!
B-b-b-because I am a lady...\xfffewaaaah...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will admit my defeat gracefully...
No matter how much I sweat,\xfffeI won't smell sweaty!\xf000븁\x0000
A healthy sweat...\xfffeBoy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
After a battle, take a bath!\xfffeAfter eating, brush your teeth!
The world championships are coming soon!\xfffeI will practice volleys\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby using you as a wall!\xf000븁\x0000
Whoa! Lemme...catch...my breath...\xfffeThat was some good training...
You and I have just met.\xfffeLet's start the game from the beginning!
Hey! Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will strike you from above.\xfffeMy attack has a height!\xf000븁\x0000
That's right.\xfffeThe Pokémon do the fighting, not me...
We always play basketball\xfffewith Pokémon here!
I will show you a powerful serve!\xfffeWatch this burn in at 120 miles per hour!\xf000븁\x0000
Your attack just now...\xfffeMore powerful!
Pokémon are sending over\xfffesome powerful serves so I can practice.
My Pokémon was so cute!
My Pokémon listened to what I said\xfffeand fought for me!
You... You came here because\xfffesomebody manipulated you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you can win against me,\xfffeI will tell you the secret!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh! I can't believe\xfffeI lost...
Ghetsis of the Seven Sages supports\xfffeour king, and Ghetsis has\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethree subordinates...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThey are the Shadow Triad!
If I win against you,\xffferelease your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Plasmaaaa!\xfffeI'm mortified.
I don't understand... Your Pokémon seem\xfffeto be happy next to you.
Pokémon living in this Chargestone Cave\xfffeare so beautiful.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBecause they are free from people.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, my! No, no.\xfffePlasmaaaa!
It's bad for ordinary Trainers like you\xfffeto use Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's good for us members of Team Plasma\xfffeto use Pokémon!
As a proud member of Team Plasma,\xfffeI will gladly battle with you.\xf000븁\x0000
As a proud member of...\xfffeTeam Plasma...
What do you fight for?\xfffeNo, what do you live for?
OK, Trainer, you use Pokémon!\xfffeShow me your strength!\xf000븁\x0000
...I see.\xfffeYou're very good at using Pokémon.
Because they use Pokémon, people hold\xfffecompetitions to sort out the strong from\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe weak...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIs this fair? Is this right?\xfffeAre Pokémon just the Trainers' tools?
The hope of Team Plasma!\xfffeWell, it has nothing to do with you.\xf000븁\x0000
Hey! What was that?\xfffeYou're too strong! Ugh!
The hope of Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe know our king will lead us.\xfffeHe will free the Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou! Release your Pokémon\xfffeand stop being a Trainer!
Since coming to Dragonspiral Tower,\xfffemy stress level has maxed out! The more\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehyper I am, the faster you'll go down!\xf000븁\x0000
Bahhh.\xfffeI have lost my motivation.
Still, this is a great tower.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI feel not only its history\xfffebut also its awe-inspiring power.
Brycen, Cheren...\xfffeThey are moving around being annoying.\xf000븁\x0000
I don't understand...\xfffeI don't understand you guys...
Why are you and the Gym Leaders\xfffeagainst us?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI just can't understand it at all.
I'm sure you also thought\xfffe“I am strong" and “I can win"\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand came here.\xf000븁\x0000
Huh...\xfffeYou thought right!
If the king of Team Plasma rules the\xfffeworld, Trainers will disappear, and\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedisputes will end!
We exist to serve our lord N!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah!\xfffeOur lord N!
Because there are nights,\xfffethe sun is beautiful.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause we exist,\xfffeour king shines...
The dawn of Unova\xfffehas faded in the distance...
Don't stop us!\xfffeI told you that we wouldn't stop.
What? It looks like you can still fight!
Even though I lost, I will still say:\xfffePlasmaaaa, go Plasmaaaa!
My Pokémon can take that!\xfffeI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\xfffeThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
My Pokémon can take that!\xfffeI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\xfffeThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
My Pokémon can take that!\xfffeI'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...\xfffeThis is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
Oh!\xfffeSo, you chose that move!
Every time I watch my Pokémon battle,\xfffeit ends like this...
The Pokémon on both sides\xfffetried sooo hard, didn't they?
Oh!\xfffeSo, you chose that move!

The Pokémon on both sides\xfffetried sooo hard, didn't they?
Moves that never miss\xfffeand moves that can attack first...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThere sure are a lot of different moves.\xf000븁\x0000
It's important to choose\xfffewhich item your Pokémon holds...
I see!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLosing to you means\xfffethat I still have a lot to learn.

B-both my Pokémon and I are\xfffegoing to give it our all!
OK!\xfffeThis little one is up next!
Uh-oh...\xfffeAm I in trouble?!
Aww...\xfffeI couldn't win...
B-both my Pokémon and I are\xfffegoing to give it our all!

Hi, hi! Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will let you see\xfffewhat kind of Pokémon I have!\xf000븁\x0000
Did you see my Pokémon?\xfffeIt's sturdy and great, isn't it?
Pokémon with the Sturdy Ability\xfffecannot be knocked out with one hit!
Hi, hi! Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease show me what kinds of Pokémon\xfffeyou are training!\xf000븁\x0000
Great, great! I didn't know\xfffethat way to raise Pokémon!
When you let a Pokémon evolve, it will be\xfffestronger, but if you don't let it evolve,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit will learn moves quicker.
I can't see up ahead\xfffebecause of the sandstorm!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause I can't see,\xfffeI'll have a battle with you!\xf000븁\x0000
S-a-n-d-s-t-o-r-m.
This parasol keeps off the sun and rain,\xfffebut it can't stand up to sandstorms...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAh! My tears are falling on Route 4...
A battle on a raised walkway!\xfffeThat's kind of cool.\xf000븁\x0000
Losing is uncool.\xfffeNo, no, you are cool.
It's good to sway wildly\xfffeon a raised walkway!
I love raised walkways!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBalancing is fun,\xfffeso I often come here to play.\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, \xfffebut I won't stop!
If you walk on a raised walkway, you can\xfffemove without encountering wild Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut if you stop to rest for a while,\xfffeyou'll fall!
Originally, Pokémon lived\xfffein the natural world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, it's good to train Pokémon\xfffein nature like this!\xf000븁\x0000
I will start all over again.\xfffeWe still have time.
Twist Mountain looks complicated, but\xfffebasically, it's a single road.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeKeep cool and move forward!\xfffeThat is the trick to reach the goal.
Being with Pokémon is natural.\xfffeHaving a Pokémon battle is natural.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhy don't we test whether that is true?\xf000븁\x0000
We are happy to be with our Pokémon.\xfffeThat's why we have battles!
If my Pokémon don't want to fight,\xfffeI will quit being a Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause there are a lot of other things\xfffeI can do with my Pokémon.
Oh! \xfffeMy groundbreaking research...
Prepare at least three Pokémon\xfffethat can fight!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRotation Battles are new battles\xfffewith three Pokémon!
Way to go!
They were rotating too much!
Rotation Battles are shocking!!
Rotation Battles are Pokémon battles\xfffewith three Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeSo prepare at least three Pokémon!
Today I am extremely lucky!
I didn't expect them to turn that way.\xfffeI am so unlucky!
Huh! \xfffeI was just unlucky today.
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\xfffein which you use three Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease get three Pokémon together\xfffeto use in battle!
OK! I will show you the results\xfffeof my daily workouts!
The result of my daily workout...\xfffedidn't really show up.
I'll work even harder raising my Pokémon!
In order to have a Triple Battle,\xfffeyou need to have at least three\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePokémon able to battle.
OK, everyone!\xfffeLet's fight together!
Your Pokémon fought\xfffeharder than mine!
There are so many things to consider,\xfffebut that is part of the fun of\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTriple Battles!
I choose a move, and\xfffemy Pokémon will do the move.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn a moment, that move will\xfffereach your Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost, but during the battle,\xfffewe were connected. Right?
This Berry may connect\xfffeyou and your Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
From today to tomorrow...\xfffepeople, Pokémon, and the world...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI love this connected feeling...
I am not running now,\xfffebut I usually barrel through\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeas quickly as I can!\xf000븁\x0000
I have not crossed\xfffethe finish line of victory!
I'm going to use this little rest\xfffeto give you this present!\xf000븁\x0000
Run and run in cities\xfffeand on mountain paths!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRun and feel the world around you\xfffewith your whole being!
I am just watching\xfffethe dangling tip of the fishhook.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSince you and I have met, let's send\xfffeour Pokémon out to meet in battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Because I love fishing and Pokémon,\xfffeI enjoy my life twice as much.
The dangling tip of the fishhook.\xfffeI am just watching it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYes, in life, even meaningless things\xfffecan have meaning.
Ouch... Why are you\xfffeso strong?
Wow! Wow! Great!\xfffeYou are stroooong!!
Hey! \xfffeYour team is strong!
Ouch... I'm so uncool...
After all, I am the strongest and greatest.\xfffeJust kidding!
Your strength...\xfffeAnd my strength... Right. Let's test them.
Can you be strong even if you lose?\xfffeIs winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.\xfffeBut what is it to be truly strong?
Your strength...\xfffeAnd my strength... Right. Let's test them.

Your strength...\xfffeAnd my strength... Right. Let's test them.
Can you be strong even if you lose?\xfffeIs winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.\xfffeBut what is it to be truly strong?
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle\xfffethat uses three Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease prepare at least three Pokémon\xfffefor battle!
The flow of a game changes\xfffeevery turn in a Rotation Battle!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCan you master it?\xf000븁\x0000
It made my head spin,\xfffeand I feel dizzy...
While a come-from-behind win is possible,\xfffeif you are a strong Trainer,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou can handle the game well.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat is the thrill of Rotation Battles!
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle\xfffein which you use three Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePlease get three Pokémon together\xfffeto use in battle!
I thought and thought\xfffeand chose these three!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeTheir destructive force is overwhelming!\xf000븁\x0000
Did I position them wrong?\xfffeOr is there a more fundamental problem?
Which Pokémon\xfffeshould I put in the middle...?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm still thinking about it.
My!\xfffeSpecial Emolga?!
Fishermen read the flow of water\xfffeor the flow of a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
The flow of the battle...\xfffeIt's too wild to follow!
The flow of water here on Route 17\xfffeis very wild.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you don't tap into it well,\xfffeyou cannot go where you want!
I am good at backstroke,\xfffefreestyle, butterfly...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd, of course, Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
Did I just lose a Pokémon battle,\xfffeeven though I'm so good at them??
Shall I practice my swimming?\xfffeOr shall I train my Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHmmmm, it's hard to decide,\xfffeso I will swim with my Pokémon!
The Pokémon is riding the wave,\xfffeand you are riding the Pokémon.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAre you riding high?\xf000븁\x0000
The big wave has come and gone...\xfffeMy heart is calm...
If you can surf calmly through the\xffferough waters of your life,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou'll be riding high!
I learned all the good points of my\xfffeAlomomola by swimming with Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI will show off its strength!\xf000븁\x0000
What a fresh Trainer!\xfffeReally fresh, fresh!
I'm a girl with everything...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, everything but a place to\xfffeput my Poké Balls!
I was taking a little break, but hey,\xfffeI always have time for Pokémon battles!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLet's enjoy it as much as possible!\xf000븁\x0000
Wooosh!\xfffeSsshhhh!!
I'll tell you why I was taking a break.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI have trouble with my bikini.\xfffeIt could be washed away...
Did you come here by looking\xfffeat the Town Map, too?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMaps are good.\xfffeThey tell you a lot of things!\xf000븁\x0000
I want something that's like a map but\xfffetells me how to fight instead of where to go.
Where shall I go next...?\xfffeI use the Town Map to decide!
I came all the way here\xfffelooking for various Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet me see what kinds of Pokémon\xfffeyou came here with!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon is...\xfffeVery cool!!
There are Pokémon Trainers\xfffeacross the water, too.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder what kinds\xfffeof Pokémon and Trainers live there...
Fights have their own rhythms!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder whose Pokémon\xfffecan fight rhythmically.\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon!\xfffeTheir movements are right on the beat!
I am living with so many rhythms!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy rhythm, the Pokémon's rhythm,\xfffeand nature's rhythm...
When I look down from a high place,\xfffeI feel very good!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon battles are the same!\xfffeI will fight looking down from the heights!\xf000븁\x0000
You're great!\xfffeI can't help but look up to you!
We climb mountains because,\xfffeno matter how hard it is,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe higher we climb,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe closer we get to the sky!
On a small rise of land...\xfffeyou and I face each other...\xf000븁\x0000
On a small rise of land,\xfffeI lost and was left speechless...
On a small rise of land...\xfffeWhat am I seeing...?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo many Trainers I faced before...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow many more Trainers I can fight...\xfffeI will cherish every battle.
Are you going deeper into Pinwheel\xfffeForest? Or to the challenge rock?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEither way, unless you are tough,\xfffeyou'll be just rooted to the spot!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, my...\xfffeYou are very tough!
Tough Trainer!\xfffeI will make your Pokémon healthy.\xf000븁\x0000
Around Pinwheel Forest, many Pokémon\xfffeuse moves to inflict problems such as\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepoison and paralysis.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIf anything happens, let me know!
Really bad!
Zowie-e-e-e!
Mmmmm...?!\xfffeThat's how you showed up?\xf000븁\x0000
Your power exceeds my\xfffepsychic power!
People say the Musharna that show up\xfffehere every Friday are a bit different.
This is a power spot!\xfffeIt awakens your dormant power!\xf000븁\x0000
Did you spot my weakness?
To tell you the truth,\xfffeeverybody has Dream Mist.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe'Cause if you can make a dream come true,\xfffeit's the same as having Dream Mist.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeRight?
Eeek! Why? I foresaw your move,\xfffeand I was running away from you.\xf000븁\x0000
Eeek! I foresaw your thoughts,\xfffebut I lost!
Dreams slip away when they almost\xfffecome true...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you don't grab important things tight,\xfffeyou will lose them.
To research strange Pokémon, having a\xfffebattle is a good approach.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDon't you think?\xf000븁\x0000
I cannot help but wonder...\xfffeWhy did I lose?
No matter how much you research,\xfffePokémon are full of new discoveries!
I've been researching\xfffewithout sleeping for days.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI see you, but are you a dream?\xf000븁\x0000
Theoretically, it's impossible!\xfffeIs this a dream...?
Talking about dreams, Fennel's\xfffePokémon DW!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat is some great research!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAre you doing Game Sync, too?
For my research on dreams,\xfffeI will research your dream!\xf000븁\x0000
No! \xfffeI may dream about this defeat later!
The Dream Mist of the\xfffePokémon Musharna...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe secret has not been unlocked,\xfffebut it must be a great ability.
I want to figure out\xfffePsychics' strange powers!\xf000븁\x0000
I decided to fight using pure logic,\xfffeyet I lost!
The things we can explain with logic\xfffeare half of the world...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe rest, we explain with feeling!\xfffeBecause the world is full of wonders.
Permets-moi de te provoquer en duel afin\xfffeque je puisse graver notre rencontre\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedans ma mémoire.\xf000븁\x0000
Notre combat est à jamais gravé\xfffedans ma mémoire!
Les paysages que nous avons admirés...\xfffeLes gens que nous avons rencontrés...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLes Pokémon avec qui nous avons\xfffecroisé le fer...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIls resteront à jamais gravés\xfffedans ma mémoire.
Tu n'imagineras jamais le nombre de\xfffepays que j'ai visités, et le nombre\xf000븀\x0000\xfffede Dresseurs que j'ai combattus!\xf000븁\x0000
Wah!\xfffeEncore un formidable souvenir de voyage!
Quand j'aurai beaucoup, beaucoup\xfffevoyagé, je rentrerai à la maison,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeet je pourrai raconter tout\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeplein de choses à ma famille!
The power of thundering waterfalls...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeExperience the great power\xfffeof a battle with me!\xf000븁\x0000
I cannot believe our attack\xfffehad no impact on you!!
I admit your strength\xfffeand give you this gift!\xf000븁\x0000
Maybe I should train my body and mind\xfffeby standing under a waterfall!
My Pokémon and I spend so much time\xfffetogether, we don't need words\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto understand one another.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDo you think you can win against us?\xf000븁\x0000
You can understand each other\xfffevery well, too!
When you see this Berry,\xfffeplease remember us!\xf000븁\x0000
I enjoy working as a Ranger, but I love\xfffeto spend my time with Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhatever happens, I won't leave\xfffemy Pokémon!
Are you raising these Pokémon all alone?\xfffeOr do you rely on Pokémon Day Care?\xf000븁\x0000
I was only thinking about Eggs...
Share this Berry with\xfffeyour precious Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
The Pokémon Day Care on Route 3!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you leave two Pokémon there,\xfffeyou may find an Egg!
My Pokémon are running around\xfffein this beautiful grassland...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffePlease take a look!\xf000븁\x0000
They were bouncing around\xfffejust a few minutes ago!
Share the Berry with your Pokémon, too!\xf000븁\x0000
They must have been tired\xfffebecause they were running around.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAww! So cute!
It's OK to have a battle\xfffeduring a picnic. Right?\xf000븁\x0000
Fey: Your Pokémon are\xfffegreat friends, aren't they?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSue: It was over while I was\xfffeconsidering what my partner would do.
I think the Pokémon in the Poké Balls\xfffetotally understand how you feel!
We two are having a picnic together!\xfffeDon't you have two Pokémon?
We will rattle you and your Pokémon\xfffewith our perfect combination.\xf000븁\x0000

To battle well in a Double Battle,\xfffewe have to know\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeour partner's Pokémon moves.
We fight as a duo.\xfffeSo you need at least two Pokémon.
I was checking for Pokémon\xfffearound here just now,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut I am also interested in you.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! \xfffeWhat interesting Pokémon!
Even similar Pokémon will have\xfffedifferent behavior and appearances\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein Unova and other regions.
I was checking the landscape\xfffearound here just now,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut I am also interested in you.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, my!\xfffeWhat an interesting Trainer!
The unevenness of this landscape...\xfffeWe can tell that the flow of a river\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecreated the undulation.
From my point of view,\xfffeart is feeling and logic!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd a beautiful battle is also\xfffefeeling and logic!\xf000븁\x0000
I could not see your strength?!
Artists can be divided\xfffeinto two types...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSome draw what they see,\xfffeand some draw what they can't see!
I am a wonderful Fisherman\xfffewho loves everything!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis Fisherman will fight\xfffewith wonderful Pokémon!!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost!\xfffeBut I still love everything!
I want to go deep-sea fishing\xfffeusing the Royal Unova\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat leaves from Castelia City!
Don't be overwhelmed\xfffeby my awesome Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm so overwhelmed that I cannot speak...
Is my fishing rod bad?\xfffeOr is it my fishing skill that's bad?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI always catch the same Pokémon.
Hm! You look like a competent\xfffePokémon Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I have a battle with you,\xfffeI may learn some secrets!\xf000븁\x0000
Yep! A strong person is strong.\xfffeAnd a weak person is weak.
The secret of fishing...\xfffeIsn't it “hurry up slowly"?
Hey! Please show me what kinds\xfffeof great Pokémon you have caught!\xf000븁\x0000
Ho ho!\xfffeThese are some impressive Pokémon!
Even if others catch great Pokémon,\xfffeI won't get jealous.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause my own Pokémon\xfffeare the best ones for me!
Our Pokémon make a nice matchup!\xf000븁\x0000
Emy: No, I can't believe it!\xfffeHow come you're so strong?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLin: Our team is the best in the whole world\xfffeever! How did you beat us?
If Pokémon are good friends,\xfffethey will be filled with power!
What? Only one Pokémon?\xfffeThen, we can't fight!
Our combination is the best!\xfffeThere is no chance we will ever lose!\xf000븁\x0000

The Abilities called Plus and Minus\xfffeare the best combination! Right?
What? Only one Pokémon?\xfffeSorry, we won't battle with you!
While we watch the beautiful scenery,\xfffelet's have an exciting Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
I was absorbed in our Pokémon battle.
The quiet sound of a multitude of waves\xfffeendlessly overlapping...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's like a first-class orchestra...\xfffeDoesn't it sound like that?
I will keep walking\xfffeon the sandy beach...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHow about that?\xfffeSounds pretty great, doesn't it?\xf000븁\x0000
I'd have more fun\xfffejust walking on the beach...
I walk on the sandy beach...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause I love footprints!
Oh?\xfffeA lovely Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWould you like to meet the Pokémon\xfffethat make me proud?\xf000븁\x0000
Uh...\xfffeShocking!!
...Looking back, when I had\xfffeups and downs, my Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewere always there for me.
Oh, a traveling Trainer!\xfffeLet's battle, just for fun!\xf000븁\x0000
Huh? Is it already over? Noooo!\xfffeI want to see more Pokémon!
When Pokémon use moves, or when they\xfffesee you and catch your eye, your heart\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebeats a little faster, doesn't it?
A woman standing alone with a parasol\xfffein one hand at the beach...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeHi... Please have a battle with me.\xf000븁\x0000
The parasol can block ultraviolet rays, \xfffebut it can't block moves...
I heard a parasol is a must\xfffeon the beach...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeBut I'm the only one who has one?
What? Will you fight against me?\xfffeIt's OK, but are you strong?\xf000븁\x0000
Ugh...\xfffeYour Pokémon are strong!
I'm happy when I am with my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat means I will be happy for years\xfffeto come! Because I'm always with them!
If I battle until I win, I will never\xfffeultimately lose!\xf000븁\x0000
Try seven times and fall eight times...\xfffeNo!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeFall down seven times, stand up eight!
The more I rise up,\xfffethe stronger my mind grows!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's why I thank you for each round\xfffethat I lost!
Do you understand why Trainers\xfffeand Pokémon are together?\xf000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon share\xfffethe sad feeling of losing half-and-half...
With a friend, you laugh twice for happy\xfffethings, and you cry half for sad ones.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat is the joy of living with Pokémon.
An expert Fisherman can time many things\xfffeperfectly and precisely!\xf000븁\x0000
Hmmmm! A lot of my timing\xfffedidn't go well!
You! It's impressive that\xfffeyou have a Super Rod!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOK! Probably you know, but\xfffeI will tell you how to use it!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFirst, you face any body of water,\xfffethen you cast with your Super Rod.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNext you must focus!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen a Pokémon bites,\xfffe“!" appears.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's your cue to reel it in!
On a bridge!\xfffeFighting Trainers!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's a perfect picture!\xf000븁\x0000
I am not weak, even though I lost.\xfffeYou, who won, are just too strong!
On a bridge!\xfffeA sentimental Trainer after his defeat!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis is also a good, tragic picture!
My Pokémon climbed many mountains and\xfffebuilt up their physiques!\xf000븁\x0000
My tears fell after the defeat.\xfffeWatch them become an ocean!
With the Pokémon move Waterfall,\xfffea Pokémon can climb a waterfall!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...There is no move called Mountainfall.
I will battle with you,\xfffebut you must relax your shoulders.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause you need to relax\xfffeto show your ability.\xf000븁\x0000
Natural stance!\xfffeYou are good!
When people try to do what they can't,\xfffethey become clumsy.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf they do what they can do very well,\xfffethey can always be themselves!
I will unveil my Pokémon to you!\xfffeThey are the best in the world!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon are also cute,\xfffebut my Pokémon are charming!
Listen. My love for my Pokémon\xfffeis the best in the world.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeNobody can beat it.
Se ripenso a quante montagne\xfffeho attraversato in lungo e in largo,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffemi viene tanta voglia di una lotta.\xf000븁\x0000
Vengono in mente altre lotte in\xfffecui ho perso proprio come adesso!
La strada percorsa non si cambia!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMa su quella da percorrere\xfffepuò accadere ancora di tutto!
What's wrong, Pokémon Trainer?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAre you lost in your journey?\xfffeNo... In your life? At times like that,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeif you fight, you'll know!\xf000븁\x0000
You have no doubts\xfffeabout your way of fighting!
Such a strong Trainer!\xfffePlease accept this!\xf000븁\x0000
Life itself is a journey, and it's\xfffenatural to get lost sometimes!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSome truths you can find\xfffeonly when you get lost!
Yoo-hoo, Pokémon!\xfffeYoo-hoo, Pokémonnnn!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYoo-hoo, are you a Trainer?!\xf000븁\x0000
A tough Trainer,\xfffeand a tough Pokémon. I lost.
I will give you this as a sign\xfffeof my respect for your toughness!\xf000븁\x0000
I am checking to see whether Pokémon\xfffethat came from other regions\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeby Poké Transfer have escaped.
I'm looking for a place...\xfffethat is not in any guidebook.\xf000븁\x0000
Your strength!\xfffeI want to put it in a guidebook!
A journey to find something new!\xfffeThat is my goal.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor example, that big rock!\xfffeYou can push it with the move Strength!
Amazing, to find a quiet spot like this\xffferight next to the big city!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWow! I got a little excited,\xfffeso I want to have a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, I have calmed down.
Do Pokémon also\xfffefeel calm in nature?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOr do they also enjoy\xfffethe glitz of cities?
Because all roads are connected, I can\xfffego anywhere and challenge anyone!\xf000븁\x0000
I felt the bond between\xfffeyou and your Pokémon!
I keep traveling\xfffeto forget my sadness...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the sad memory returns\xfffeevery time a season passes.
I ride a Bicycle,\xfffeI feel fresh winds,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand I win Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000
A pleasant wind is carrying a defeat.\xfffe...Now, it is stopping here, though.
Most people don't know this,\xfffebut coming to Nimbasa\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand riding a Bicycle is very popular.
Ting-a-ling-ling. ♪\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI will have a Pokémon battle\xfffeat this speed!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm upset because I lost,\xfffeso I will ring the bell. Ting-a-ling. ♪
If you ride a Bicycle,\xfffeyou zip along!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf you are with Pokémon,\xfffeyou can do many things.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's fun to do things\xfffeyou can't usually do!
I am patrolling.\xfffeI will check your strength, too!\xf000븁\x0000
You were so strong\xfffethat I couldn't help falling back!
Nothing scares me\xfffewhen I patrol with my Pokémon!
I will show you the harshness\xfffeof the desert through a battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Desert...hot... Mouth...dry... Grfrrrfl...
Be careful of burns!\xf000븁\x0000
If a Pokémon gets a burn, \xfffeit also weakens physical attacks.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThis works quite well!
Scorching desert!\xfffeA passion for adventure!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAnd a heated battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!!
Speed is crucial\xfffeto treat a burn!\xf000븁\x0000
Whether it is hot or cold,\xfffethere is no problem if you have passion!
But you are just so relaxed! How could you\xfffewin against a busy person like me?
Oh, my! How strong you are!
Oh!\xfffeImpressive strength!
Oh... I lost.\xfffeYou're very strong!
What?\xfffeHow could I lose?
This...\xfffeThis is ridiculous!
Your strength was more than I imagined!\xfffeI am pleased!
Come on! Seriously?! All I did was\xfffetake away people's Pokémon.
We finally reached the secret sleeping in\xfffethe basement of the lighthouse.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI won't let you interrupt us!\xf000븁\x0000
I am bitterly disappointed...
In the basement of the lighthouse\xfffebuilt over 200 years ago,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe mythical Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeVictini was sleeping!
I was ordered not to let anyone\xfffeapproach the Plasma Ship!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost the battle though...
Although I lost, I won't move!\xfffeI will follow my orders!
We will release Victini\xfffefrom its confinement\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein a small basement on the island!\xf000븁\x0000
You're sabotaging\xfffeour noble cause!
Selfish people are making\xfffeVictini suffer...
The Victini on this island\xfffecreates limitless energy!\xf000븁\x0000
You are just a kid!
If you are exposed to Victini's energy,\xfffeyou can win any kind of battle.
I failed to seize the victory!
The beginning is always important\xfffefor both battles and novels.
Oh... I guess it's time to start\xfffemy last chapter.
The epilogue of this story\xfffeis about to begin.
Wow. I'm stunned.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor all the words I know, I can't figure out\xfffehow to say this... Putting my feelings\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeinto words would just be a trap.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAll I will say is I feel you're even greater\xfffethan I thought!
You use the move here...\xfffeIt's good. It's fascinating.
Well... I've never withdrawn\xfffefrom any battles.
Even in this situation,\xfffethere must be a way...to win.
If somebody wins, the person who fought\xfffeagainst that person will lose.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's battle.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeA good contender just seeks the next\xfffevictory without bragging after winning,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand without getting upset after losing.
Oh! Strong as usual.\xfffeThat makes my heart dance!
The last one!\xfffeI'll use the last bit of strength!
Oh... This may be the last.\xfffeI will put everything into the next move!
There is no strongest Pokémon or single\xfffebest combination...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo, there are no guarantees of winning.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the determination to be strong and to\xfffecontinue to grow and improve is itself a\xf000븀\x0000\xfffegreat strength. It's the determination\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat you show that makes me respect you.
A wonderful time is about to start.\xfffeI like this moment...
I will stay cool and collected, even though\xfffethis isn't going well...
I will not give up...for the sake of my\xfffePokémon that believe in me.
As you have always been...or even more\xfffethan ever...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou are an elegant and excellent Trainer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYour Pokémon also have class.\xfffeI am very pleased to have battled you.
Do you really think you can stop us\xfffewith that?
My last friend...\xfffePlease share your courage with me!
Is the world going to choose you,\xfffeand not me?!
Everything’s ruined. The ideals I held...\xfffeThe dreams Pokémon shared...
Your Pokémon look happy.
Even if I lose, is it different from the\xfffefuture I saw?
The result was the same...\xfffeBut you... Who are you?
When was the last time\xfffeI was driven into a corner like this?
You haven't won yet! I won't let\xfffesuch a fun battle end so easily!
My heart is pounding so hard because I had\xfffesuch a heated battle with you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou are a really great Trainer!!
I bought new boots,\xfffeso I came all this way to get them dirty.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou're right! If I have a battle,\xfffethey may get even dirtier!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! My boots got completely soaked\xfffein the battle!
I would feel sorry for boots\xfffeif I cared about them getting dirty.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePokémon are the same. Right?\xfffeI feel sorry for them getting hurt,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut it makes them stronger.
If there are Trainers,\xfffeI just have battles with them.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause they may show me\xfffeWater-type Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI've never seen.\xf000븁\x0000
I've never seen\xfffesuch a strong Trainer!
If I find water, I drop in my fishing line.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBecause even with a puddle,\xfffethere may be Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat I've never seen.
Knowing oneself, knowing the other,\xfffeand knowing the surroundings...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's a Ranger!\xf000븁\x0000
I guess there's still\xfffea lot I don't know!
If you are prepared,\xfffeyou don't have to worry!\xf000븁\x0000
I'm researching what kinds of\xfffePokémon live around here.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat way, I can plan which Pokémon\xfffeI should take along.
Pokémon Trainers nurture friendship\xfffewith their battles!\xf000븁\x0000
This feeling of defeat...\xfffeis like a bottomless swamp...
Please accept this Sitrus Berry\xfffeas a token of our friendship!\xf000븁\x0000
Stay still and listen carefully!\xfffeHear the sounds of nearby Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe breath of trees and swamps.
I got tired of Pokémon battles\xfffewith the same people,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeso I want to have a battle with you!\xf000븁\x0000
Wow! Surprising!\xfffeThe move just now was great!
The Pokémon called Burmy\xfffecan change their forms\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedepending on where they battle!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIsn't that great??
Eeek!!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHey! Don't sneak up\xfffeon me like that!\xf000븁\x0000
Argh, I lost again...\xfffeI'm a little bit sad.
I was writing this and that on the wall.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, I will never show it to you!\xfffe...Because it's my secret!
Let's compare whose Pokémon\xfffeare stronger!\xf000븁\x0000
You won!\xfffeYour Pokémon are awesome!
I scrape my legs a lot\xfffe'cause I'm wearing shorts.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut I'm fine!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy Pokémon lick the scraped parts!
This is our playground!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeGreat Landorus, watch out for us!\xf000븁\x0000
Wahaha!\xfffeYour Pokémon looks like it is having fun!
Great Landorus...\xfffeIs it a strong and kind Pokémon?
If you have the move Dive,\xfffeyou can dive and sink!\xf000븁\x0000
Blub, blub, blub...\xfffe...I am sinking.
Have your Pokémon\xfffelearned the move Dive?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeDive is good! Great!\xfffe'Cause it's Dive!
I just love swimming, so I have only\xfffefought against wild Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
I guess people get strong\xfffeby visiting Gyms!
OK! I will challenge Pokémon in Gyms\xfffeall over the world!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhere do I find Water-type Gyms...\xfffeKanto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh, right?
My Pokémon and I are always swimming.\xfffeOf course, I can battle while swimming!\xf000븁\x0000
I lost. But I'm still cool, because not many\xfffepeople can say they battled while swimming!
They say a temple sank\xfffeto the ocean floor in Undella!
Seeing a Pokémon use its best moves\xfffeagainst another Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis really an adventure!\xf000븁\x0000
The adventure is over already.
I am on vacation\xfffeall year round...
Oh? Did you come here to see\xfffeCynthia in a bathing suit?\xf000븁\x0000
You should put on a bathing suit and swim\xfffeinstead of riding on a Pokémon!
I heard that Cynthia swims secretly\xfffewhen nobody else is around.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd I heard she is great!\xfffeJust great!
The sea waves in Undella Town are\xfffenice and calm!\xf000븁\x0000
Your battling style\xfffeis very rough and ready!
Floating in the sea, very nice!\xfffeBeing with Pokémon, very nice!
What I learned after reading many books\xfffeis that there are still a lot of mysteries\xf000븀\x0000\xfffein the world!\xf000븁\x0000
How we can be friendlier with Pokémon\xfffeis also a mystery.
The book I am reading now was\xfffewritten by Professor Juniper.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt says the origin of Pokémon\xfffeis still a mystery.
I've been researching the Village Bridge,\xfffebut taking a break is also important!\xf000븁\x0000
You and your Pokémon!\xfffeYou are supporting each other perfectly!
In the Village Bridge,\xfffea lot of bricks support each other\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand keep the bridge from collapsing.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThat's how the bridge has kept its shape\xfffefor over 100 years.
My journey has taught me\xfffethat everybody loves Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI'm sure you love them, too.\xf000븁\x0000
Although we lost,\xfffeour journey will still continue!
We will keep walking!\xfffeAs long as the road goes on...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeAs long as I am with my Pokémon!
You are the 99th person\xfffethat I have greeted this way.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeLet's have a Pokémon battle!\xf000븁\x0000
Thank you! Now you and I are friends.\xfffeRight?
If we could greet anyone in the world\xfffewith “Let's have a Pokémon battle!"\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat would be wonderful!
My movements lack power!
I was off the beat!\xfffeI have to start up my lessons again!
My footwork was not quite sharp.
Plasmaaaa!\xfffeI have fallen in the Relic Castle...
The strength that beat my lord N.\xfffeI see... It cut me to the bone.
That strength has protected\xfffethe world in which people and Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelive together.
I will use everything that I've learned on\xfffethis journey!
My Pokémon and I will\xfffeput all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.\xfffeYou are really great.
I will use everything that I've learned on\xfffethis journey!

You may have beaten me, but you're still no\xfffebetter than other Trainers around here.
My lord N grew up with Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHe thinks about Pokémon more than\xfffeanybody else!

Grunt: Ugh, you're strong...\xf000븁\x0000But that strength only comes as\xfffea result of you trainers\xf000븀\x0000controlling Pokémon, doesn't it?!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: ...So you want\xfffeto liberate Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000If that's what you desire,\xfffeyou can very well try.\xf000븁\x0000But resorting to force and\xfffestealing everyone's Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000is just wrong, no matter what.\xf000븀\x0000That's not strength!\xf000븁\x0000

Cheren: I'm... not sure what they might\xfffehave gotten their hands on, but...\xf000븁\x0000They're real pests, even going so far\xfffeas getting stronger\xf000븀\x0000just to annoy everyone...\xf000븁\x0000

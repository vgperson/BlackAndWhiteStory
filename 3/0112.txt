Oh! It's you!\xfffeYou must be \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
Can I take a quick look\xfffeat your Pokédex?\xf000븁\x0000Hmmm... Yes...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo you've found \xf000Ȃ\x0001\x0000 Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! And you've found Klink?!\xfffeYou're quite the Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000
Hrm...\xfffeYou haven't found Klink yet...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut still, that's quite a Pokédex!\xf000븁\x0000
Oops, I'm sorry!\xfffeI got a little overexcited there.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeMy name is... ALSO Juniper!\xf000븁\x0000That's right! My daughter is the\xfffeone who made your Pokédex!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeShe's told me all sorts\xfffeof things about you.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm just overjoyed I could\xfffemeet you here!\xf000븁\x0000
So in commemoration of our meeting,\xfffelet me upgrade your Pokédex! Okay?\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000's Pokédex was upgraded!
Juniper: There are some Pokémon that\xfffeare of the same species,\xf000븀\x0000but have different forms.\xf000븁\x0000With this upgrade, you now can keep\xfffetrack of which forms you've seen!\xf000븁\x0000Plus, I've added some additional\xfffefunctions to make it easier\xf000븀\x0000to search for Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
???: Professor Juniper,\xfffewho's this Trainer?\xf000븁\x0000
Juniper: Oh! ...Oh!\xfffeSorry, I'm sorry.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFlo, this is \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffean acquaintance of my daughter!\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000's journeying through Unova,\xfffeaiming to complete the Pokédex.\xf000븁\x0000
Flo: I see! Then you'll probably\xfffechallenge the gym here, right?\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWow! I'm looking forward to it!\xf000븁\x0000
Juniper: Yeah, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeIt'd be great if you challenged her!\xf000븁\x0000I'm sure you'll just soar right\xfffethrough the gym here!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, Flo, if anything comes up\xfffeagain, I'm counting on you!\xf000븁\x0000
Flo: ...Professor, my plane's\xfffea cargo plane!\xf000븁\x0000It carries luggage, not people.\xf000븁\x0000...Not to mention places like Kanto\xfffeand Sinnoh aren't easy destinations!\xf000븁\x0000
Juniper: Hey, now, don't be\xfffeso harsh while you're making\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesuch a cute face...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHumans need to help each other,\xfffejust like we do with Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, you two,\xfffehope we meet again!\xf000븁\x0000
Flo: ...Why!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo irresponsible for a world-renowned\xfffePokémon professor!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI still don't believe it.\xf000븁\x0000
Now, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000As the gym leader, I'd be very\xfffeglad if you were to\xf000븀\x0000challenge my gym.\xf000븁\x0000But first, there's something\xfffeI need to do.\xf000븁\x0000
Now, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000As the gym leader, I'd be very\xfffeglad if you were to\xf000븀\x0000challenge my gym.\xf000븁\x0000But first, there's something\xfffeI need to do.\xf000븁\x0000
Earlier, when I was flying\xfffemy cargo plane...\xf000븁\x0000I saw something atop\xfffethe Tower of Heaven.\xf000븁\x0000It was a weakened Pokémon,\xfffeI'm sure of it!\xf000븁\x0000
I can't very well ignore it,\xfffenow can I?\xf000븁\x0000So I'm going ahead and investigating!\xf000븁\x0000That said, I'm going to the\xfffeTower of Heaven on Route 7...\xf000븀\x0000And if you want, you can come too.\xf000븁\x0000
Miss Flo?\xf000븁\x0000She finished her business with her cargo\xfffeand went off somewhere...\xf000븁\x0000Maybe check out the\xfffeTower of Heaven on Route 7?
N: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001...To understand each other,\xfffeTrainers struggle through battle,\xf000븀\x0000and wound Pokémon in the process.\xf000븁\x0000Am I the only one? The only one\xfffewho sees how very painful it is?\xf000븁\x0000Regardless... I have\xfffespoken to your Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000...Since the day I was born,\xfffeI have been brought up with Pokémon.\xf000븀\x0000It's more comfortable to me\xf000븀\x0000than talking with people.\xf000븁\x0000So I know Pokémon cannot ever lie.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001\xf000ā\x0001\x0000...\xf000븁\x0000Would you tell me what\xfffekind of Trainer \xf000Ā\x0001\x0001 is?\xf000븉\x0001\x0000\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001...I see. So you were born\xfffeand raised in Kanoko Town,\xf000븀\x0000together with your mother...\xf000븁\x0000Taking the opportunity presented to\xfffeyou by the Pokédex, you are\xf000븀\x0000out on a journey to see the world...\xf000븀\x0000Hmm.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001Even so, for whatever reason, this\xfffe\xf000ā\x0001\x0001 seems to believe in you...\xf000븀\x0000How splendid...!\xf000븁\x0000If only all people could get\xfffealong with Pokémon as you all do...\xf000븁\x0000Yet the fate of Pokémon and humans\xfffeis left in the hands of those\xf000븀\x0000who use Pokémon for themselves...\xf000븁\x0000Getis is having Team Plasma\xfffesearch for a special stone.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001The paired Light Stone and Dark Stone...\xfffethey are what we seek.\xf000븁\x0000The body of the legendary Pokémon\xfffewas destroyed, and it sleeps\xf000븀\x0000in the form of a stone,\xf000븀\x0000awaiting the hero's return...\xf000븉\x0001\x0000\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001I will revive the legendary Pokémon\xfffefrom its slumber.\xf000븁\x0000And I will befriend it, and the world\xfffewill recognize me as a hero...\xf000븉\x0001\x0000\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001...My dream is to make this\xfffea world without strife.\xf000븁\x0000If the world is changed by force,\xfffethere will be those who oppose it.\xf000븁\x0000And when there is opposition,\xfffethose wounded are the innocent Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000whom foolish Trainers abuse...\xf000븁\x0000Yes... Pokémon are not\xfffeplaythings for people to control!\xf000븉\x0001\x0000\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001As such...\xf000븁\x0000It pains me a little to separate\xfffeTrainers from their Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000when there are ones like you\xf000븀\x0000who respect each other...\xf000븉\x0001\x0000\xf000븁\x0000
Airplanes! Behold their form!\xfffeAnd the design that gives them flight!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd the mechanics behind that flight...\xfffethey let nothing go to waste!
The Fukiyose airport\xfffeonly flies cargo planes.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen Trainers want to fly,\xfffethat's what the move Fly is for!
Miss Flo's grandpa was\xfffea legendary airplane pilot!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOh, Miss Flo is this town's\xfffegym leader, of course!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeShe's such a kind girl!
Pokémon and people cleared desolate\xfffeland so that everyone could live on it...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm certain that optimistic spirit\xfffewill never change!
If you're careful, it doesn't matter\xfffeif you play on the runway!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe cargo planes only set out\xfffeabout once a day.
There seem to be a fair number\xfffewho have had their Pokémon stolen\xf000븀\x0000by Team Plasma...
When you want yummy vegetables,\xfffegrowing them naturally is best!\xf000븁\x0000Having to endure changing weather\xfffealways seems to help the taste!\xf000븁\x0000You can tell because Pokémon often\xfffeeat them while they're growing...
Using a greenhouse is the\xfffebest way to grow vegetables!\xf000븁\x0000The temperature and nourishment\xfffecan all be systematically controlled.\xf000븁\x0000With nothing going to waste,\xfffethe vegetables end up perfectly tasty!
Ahhh!\xfffeYou found our treasure!!\xf000븁\x0000
You found it!!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, geez...\xf000븁\x0000Our Pokémon aren't worthy!\xfffeWe were trying to hide\xf000븀\x0000that Technical Machine, but...\xf000븁\x0000But since we're not worthy,\xfffeyou can use it, mister!\xf000븁\x0000We can get another one\xfffefrom miss Flo anyway!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, geez...\xf000븁\x0000Our Pokémon aren't worthy!\xfffeWe were trying to hide\xf000븀\x0000that Technical Machine, but...\xf000븁\x0000But since we're not worthy,\xfffeyou can use it, miss!\xf000븁\x0000We can get another one\xfffefrom miss Flo anyway!\xf000븁\x0000

I want to know the future!\xf000븁\x0000I'm so anxious...\xfffeI wonder what kind of future\xf000븀\x0000my child Emit might live in...\xf000븁\x0000So I'm making a machine\xfffethat links the future and present,\xf000븀\x0000but I don't have enough power...\xf000븁\x0000
Somewhere, there seems to be\xfffeanother town named Souryuu,\xf000븀\x0000but it's more futuristic.\xf000븁\x0000If you brought me a Pokémon from\xfffethat town that knows Charge,\xf000븀\x0000my machine might work.\xf000븁\x0000If you could,\xfffewould you show me\xf000븀\x0000a Pokémon that knows Charge?
I... I see, that's too bad.\xfffeIf you change your mind, come again.
Th-thank you!\xfffeThis should power the machine!\xf000븁\x0000
Th-thank you!\xf000븁\x0000...But that doesn't fulfill the terms\xfffeof my request at all!!
Th-thank you!\xf000븁\x0000...But, while that Pokémon knows Charge,\xfffeit wasn't born in a futuristic town...
Now... show me the future!\xf000븁\x0000
KREEEEEEEEEEN...\xf000븁\x0000
Ohhh! The future...\xfffeThe future is like THIS?!\xf000븁\x0000My beloved Emit!\xf000븁\x0000I've raised him well!\xf000븁\x0000
...Are we back to normal?\xf000븁\x0000Well, it was a good experience!\xfffeI can't stop shaking!\xf000븁\x0000But... even knowing the future,\xfffemy "now" will never change...\xf000븁\x0000
Right!\xfffeHere's your Pokémon back.\xf000븁\x0000Thank you!\xfffeThis is my gift to you!\xf000븁\x0000
It's not worth worrying about\xfffethe future when it's more important\xf000븀\x0000that I live to the fullest\xf000븀\x0000the present leading to it...!\xf000븁\x0000Alright, Emit! Let's go out!\xfffeToday's a day to play!
Emit: Hey! Hey! What should I\xfffebe when I grow up?
I want to return to the past!\xfffeI want to redo it all!\xf000븁\x0000My dad Levart made a\xfffemachine to see the future...\xf000븁\x0000So I'm making a machine\xfffethat links the present and past...\xf000븀\x0000...But I don't have enough power.\xf000븁\x0000
Somewhere, there seems to be\xfffeanother town named Souryuu,\xf000븀\x0000but it's more rustic.\xf000븁\x0000If you brought me a Pokémon from\xfffethat town that knows Charge,\xf000븀\x0000my machine might work.\xf000븁\x0000If you could,\xfffewould you show me\xf000븀\x0000a Pokémon that knows Charge?
Huh... too bad.\xfffeBut I see no other ways...
Yes!\xfffeOkay, starting the machine!\xf000븁\x0000
Th-thank you!\xf000븁\x0000...But that doesn't fulfill the terms\xfffeof my request at all!!
Th-thank you!\xf000븁\x0000...But, while that Pokémon knows Charge,\xfffeit wasn't born in a rustic town...
Now we'll connect to the past!\xf000븁\x0000
We're in the past...?!\xf000븁\x0000Dad!!\xf000븁\x0000It's me, Emit!\xfffeI want to apologize for...!\xf000븁\x0000
We went back?\xfffeThe power must have cut...\xf000븁\x0000I went back to the past, but...\xfffeMy "now" will never change...\xf000븁\x0000
Right!\xfffeHere's your Pokémon back.\xf000븁\x0000Thanks!\xfffeThis is my gift to you!\xf000븁\x0000
It's not worth regretting the past\xfffewhen it's more important\xf000븀\x0000that I live to the fullest\xf000븀\x0000the present it's led to...\xf000븁\x0000Right!\xfffeI'll look forward and live!

Kagome Town...\xf000븁\x0000The city where all people are\xfffeonly outside when it is day...\xf000븁\x0000It is said that the people are\xfffestill scared of the monster who\xf000븀\x0000came down together with the meteor.
Hello, did you maybe come for\xfffesome information about the\xf000븀\x0000history of Kagome Town?\xf000븁\x0000I'd be pleased to tell you\xfffesomething about its history.
Long ago, there was a meteor\xfffefalling down to earth.\xf000븁\x0000The people living here were all\xfffescared that the meteor would hit here!\xf000븀\x0000But it didn't...\xf000븁\x0000But what it did, is it brought a\xfffevery scary monster to the earth...\xf000븀\x0000We still believe in it now...\xf000븁\x0000We are still scared of the monster.\xfffeThat is exactly why we stay inside\xf000븀\x0000our houses at night...\xf000븀\x0000Just because of that monster...\xf000븀\x0000Pfew... I'm a bit scared of it too.\xf000븁\x0000It is a blessing that the monster\xfffeonly comes to our town at nights...\xf000븀\x0000What would happen if it came at day?\xf000븁\x0000Well... I don't really know the answer to\xfffethat. But I guess the town would've\xf000븀\x0000been very different then...\xf000븁\x0000
... ... ... ... ...\xfffeThere is a riddle made of this\xf000븀\x0000old story...\xf000븁\x0000But...\xf000븁\x0000I don't remember it anymore...\xfffeIt's just a shame I don't remember\xf000븀\x0000the old riddle any more...\xf000븁\x0000Well... Thank you for listening.\xfffeI like to keep the story living, no\xf000븀\x0000matter what happens. If I\xf000븀\x0000don't, the story won't be remembered!
Well, too bad...\xfffeMaybe some other time?
I'm scared of the monster...\xfffeI mean, it only appears at nights!\xf000븀\x0000That is just... Scary!\xf000븀\x0000That's why my mom tells me to\xf000븀\x0000always be inside at nights!
Wow... What a beautiful town...\xfffeI just like the old-fashioned towns.\xf000븁\x0000You know? The towns with the\xfffeamazing stories and old looks!
Hmmm...\xfffeYeah, I really like that story.\xf000븀\x0000I don't know why, but I like\xf000븀\x0000that story! I just... Like it!
What am I doing here?\xfffeI'm just thinking of my husband...\xf000븀\x0000He disappeared all of a sudden...
Hey there!\xfffeDid you listen to the town elder?\xf000븁\x0000She has a beautiful but scary\xfffestory to tell you! Check it out!

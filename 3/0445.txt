Kagome Town\xfffeA peacefully-constructed triangle!
This is Kagome Town...\xf000븁\x0000Where people live properly\xfffefrom good morning to good night...\xf000븁\x0000When we live bathing\xfffein the light of the sun,\xf000븀\x0000we sleep soundly in the night.
Just a second, traveler!\xfffeWant me to tell you\xf000븀\x0000about the history of Kagome Town?\xf000븁\x0000As an old woman's tale,\xfffeit might get a little long...
There is a very, very large\xfffehole under this town.\xf000븁\x0000That hole was formed long, long ago,\xfffewhen a great meteor fell from the sky.\xf000븁\x0000And in the meteor, there lurked\xfffea most fearful beast...\xf000븁\x0000It is said the beast would appear at\xfffenight, bringing a cold wind with it,\xf000븀\x0000and take people and Pokémon alike...\xf000븀\x0000to devour them!\xf000븁\x0000So the ancient people built\xfffea wall to keep the beast out.\xf000븁\x0000And to stay inside when the sun\xfffewas set became a law of the town...\xf000븁\x0000
... ... ... ... ...\xfffeWell, no one really believes\xf000븀\x0000in such a tale anymore.\xf000븁\x0000However...\xf000븁\x0000To this day, the people of Kagome\xfffealways make sure to get home\xf000븀\x0000at night... curious, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000Just how much of our lives today\xfffeis influenced by legends and tradition?
Ah, I see...\xfffeIf you have time, do come again!
When night falls, a big bad\xfffemonster comes out of the hole,\xf000븀\x0000so you better just come home!
On the route ahead, lovers of fishing\xfffespread across the coast!\xf000븁\x0000Today and tomorrow, they'll be throwing\xfffeout and pulling in their rods!
My granny loves her old legends...\xfffeAnd they always take forever!
There are many people in the world.\xfffeAnd every one of those people\xf000븀\x0000has their own personality and ideas...
Ever since I got appointed here,\xfffeI haven't had to do a thing!\xf000븁\x0000There's not a soul out at night...\xfffeIt's the picture of peace!
Goo-goo! Goo-goo!
My Pokémon always go off\xfffeto play on their own...

No, no, a thousand times NO!!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: But I...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI got a Pokémon,\xfffeand I'll be a great Trainer, watch!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI can totally go on an adventure!\xf000븁\x0000

Bianca's Dad: Well, now...\xfffeI wonder what Bianca'll have to say\xf000븀\x0000next time she comes home?\xf000븀\x0000I'm looking forward to it.
Bianca's Dad: You want to do many things,\xfffebut you're all on your own...\xf000븁\x0000That's some people's greatest regret.
Bianca's Mom: Choosing one thing\xfffemeans giving up on another...\xf000븁\x0000So it's only natural that\xfffeone often doesn't want to decide.
Bianca: I was just looking back\xfffethrough my Pokédex, and...\xf000븁\x0000I really HAVE met a\xfffeton of Pokémon, haven't I?

Challenge suspended.
Successive battles sure are stressful...\xfffeIt's nice to rest for a bit here.
Get more Battle Points and give\xfffeyour Pokémon some good items!
Fighting seven fights in a row\xfffehelps make Trainers and Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000stronger and more resistant!
Personally, I only use the\xfffecutey-wootiest of Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000Do you have any particular...\xfffethingies like that?
All RIGHT! All set!\xfffeLet's go on a battling adventure!
Gasp... pant... tired...\xf000븁\x0000These Trainers are tough!\xfffeI'm not sure how long I'll last...
You know the Subway Masters?\xf000븁\x0000They only appear to challenge\xfffestrong Trainers to a battle.\xf000븀\x0000They're the bosses of the Subway!
That last battle was painful...\xf000븁\x0000I should trade my BP\xfffefor some better items!
My trip goes ooon, for Pokémooon!\xfffeSo long as I wiiin, I ride the... wiiind!
Gotta keep my spirits up!\xfffeYou do your best!
The Trainers here are tough\xffferight from the get-go!
That makes 42 in a row...\xfffeYeah, I'm not too bad, either!
I'm at... 84 in a row...\xfffeThis must be... a dream...?
You beat 14 in a row, too!\xfffeNot bad! Not bad!
The Super Trains\xfffehave no end!\xf000븁\x0000So basically, if you so wish,\xfffeand if you can keep winning,\xf000븀\x0000the journey will last forever!
We can still go for it!\xfffeWe can still win!
The Trainers here all have\xfffereal serious looks...\xf000븀\x0000And a glimmer in their eyes!
Is this the limit of my post...?\xf000븁\x0000The light of trains coming to the\xfffeplatform is so terribly bright!
The Subway Masters are\xfffestrange, mysterious fellows...\xf000븁\x0000I didn't think they would be\xfffequite so serious about their job...
I'm taking up this challenge\xfffealongside my police training!
Justice is always being served here!\xfffeThis must be paradise!
The journey has only begun!\xfffeLet neither of us be beaten!
It's a bit depressing being\xfffeon a station platform alone...\xf000븁\x0000It's where people leave,\xfffeso it brings back such memories...
Subway Masters?\xfffePiece of cake, I tell ya!\xf000븁\x0000Next time I'll have to\xfffegive the Super Train a shot!
These Trainers are so strong!\xfffeI'm feeling a little uneasy...
Thinkin' this is as far as my\xfffePokémon's able abilities'll take me...\xf000븁\x0000Couldn't realize my dream...\xfffeStrange young youngster,\xf000븀\x0000I'm leaving this up to you!\xf000븁\x0000And here's the proof...\xfffeGo on and take it, now...\xf000븁\x0000
I'mma go back to my hometown\xfffeand settle down with some artsy art...
Mwohohoho...\xf000븁\x0000Yes, I have FAR surpassed\xfffemy prior attempts!
A battle between two excellent\xfffeTrainers is certainly a kind of art!
The Subway Masters...\xfffeWell, for being called Masters...\xf000븀\x0000I don't think they're so tough.\xf000븁\x0000They sorta...\xf000븁\x0000Well, it mostly just seemed like\xfffethey were testing our strength.
Aaaaallrighty!\xf000븁\x0000Gonna get back\xfffeon the road soon!
Give me a sec!\xfffeMy Pokémon have fought a ton...
Hurp!\xf000븁\x0000The trains have made me sick...
You beat our boss, eh?\xfffeNot bad, kiddo!\xf000븁\x0000Well, that means you're now able\xfffeto challenge the Super Train!\xf000븁\x0000The Super Train Trainers\xfffeare SUPER strong, for real!\xf000븁\x0000If you wanna know what\xfffethe Battle Subway's really like,\xf000븀\x0000you gotta give it a shot!
I long for the excitement of battle\xfffeover the drudgery of driving...
Where did you come from?\xfffeAnd where are you headed?
We railway workers work to preserve\xfffepeace and order at the stations.\xf000븁\x0000We kindly ask that on the platforms,\xfffeyou refrain from littering,\xf000븀\x0000loitering, playing loud instruments,\xf000븀\x0000and other such disruptions.
Much like machinery, Pokémon\xfffeneed occasional maintenance too.\xf000븁\x0000Like revising what moves\xfffethey know, for example.
No stupid gimmicks...\xf000븁\x0000No unnecessary items...\xf000븁\x0000Just you and your Pokémon\xfffegiving it their all...\xf000븁\x0000What a paradise this is...
Can you break 100 in a row...?\xf000븁\x0000If you can pull that off,\xfffeyou'd be on level with the Champion!
The Super Train Trainers are strong\xfffebeyond your worst nightmares!
I relished it...\xf000븁\x0000The joy of battle...\xf000븁\x0000I can't...\xf000븁\x0000It's so uncivilized...\xf000븁\x0000But I'm already on\xfffethe road of battle now...
Hey there! I'm Unova's most\xfffeawesome, most genius pilot!\xf000븁\x0000Yes, I'm here too!
I'm beginning to see\xfffeaces like me all over...\xf000븁\x0000I would certainly suspect it's not\xfffegoing to be easy from here on out.
It's starting to get truly rough,\xfffeeven for an ace such as myself!
Yo, how you feelin'?\xfffeI'm still up to it!
YES! SEVENTY-SEVEN! In a ROW!\xfffeI like those numbers a lot!
Hmph! We've defeated\xfffeover three hundred Trainers...
Oh, hello there,\xfffefrail little Trainer...\xf000븁\x0000I fear battling you would\xfffesimply bore me to tears...\xf000븁\x0000Here, have this, and do try\xfffeto get a little stronger.\xf000븁\x0000
My interest lies only\xfffewith formidable foes...\xf000븁\x0000If you were to get strong, however,\xfffethen I would gladly battle you.
There are less people on the platform...\xfffeI suppose that goes to show\xf000븀\x0000how relentless the Battle Subway is?
... ... ... ... ...\xf000븁\x0000Uh? Whatzit? You?\xf000븁\x0000I'm busy working on a strategy\xfffeto use in my next battle.\xf000븁\x0000So, I'm sorry, but could you\xfffeplease not talk to me?
Ha! 91 in a row!\xfffeWhy, it was but a matter of course!\xf000븁\x0000And the tellings of my glory\xfffewill creep ever onward!
You...\xfffehave the same eyes I do...\xf000븁\x0000A sheer joy for battle...\xf000븁\x0000No, more... ...\xf000븁\x0000You LIVE for battle...\xf000븁\x0000Just like me...\xfffeWell... I'll give you this.\xf000븁\x0000
You'll keep battling, of course?\xfffeThat's just how we are...
If I do awesome enough here,\xfffeI'll be on the road to stardom!
Yo, how you fairin'?\xfffeI've still got some in me!
It's just Pokémon! And yet,\xfffewhat things Pokémon can do...\xf000븀\x0000The world of Pokémon is so very deep.
Place seems so big when you clean it...\xfffeYou can take this if you like.\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, I don't need no thanks.\xfffeJust found it in a trash can.\xf000븁\x0000Shame how many people these days'll\xfffereadily throw good stuff away...
Even a janitor can have\xfffeconfidence in their ability!
Getcher balls ready!\xfffeIt's time to battle!
I like ya, too!
To have put a veteran like me\xfffein such a dire situation...\xf000븁\x0000Where on earth did\xfffethese Trainers practice?
What's up, Trainer?\xfffeGettin' worn out yet?
Mumble, grumble...\xf000븁\x0000I always pray to my family\xfffeto grant me luck for each battle,...
I saw one of yer battles!\xf000븁\x0000Your technique, your judgement...\xfffeI know it'll getcha further still!
There aren't as many people...\xf000븁\x0000But the ones who ARE here\xfffeare true warriors, every one...
Should a veteran be unprepared,\xfffeeven a pupil can defeat them.\xf000븁\x0000Even an instant of negligence can\xfffespell doom in a Pokémon battle...
Just a little more until 50!\xfffeI've got a second wind now!
You look like you have an unquenchable\xfffethirst for Pokémon battles!\xf000븁\x0000And if you keep up the pace\xfffewith your battles...\xf000븁\x0000Heh heh...\xf000븁\x0000I look forward to it...
You and I are both\xfffeat 91 in a row!\xf000븁\x0000Think either of us\xfffewill make it to 100?
Battle in the morning,\xfffebattle in the evening...\xf000븁\x0000The train clatters on...\xf000븁\x0000How many hours has it been\xfffesince we left Nimbassa City...?
This is the last stop...\xf000븁\x0000The journey seemed so short...\xfffeI sorta don't wanna go back...
Having come this far,\xfffeyou're at 14 in a row.\xf000븁\x0000Which so happens to be...\xfffej-u-u-u-ust like my age!\xf000븁\x0000Teeheeheehee...
Being told how far you've come\xfffereally makes you realize how far it is...
This is the end of the line...?\xf000븁\x0000Which means the end of\xfffemy Pokémon-battling journey...
Heh...\xf000븁\x0000My body can easily withstand\xfffethe hardships of a long journey!
Hmm, 28 in a row, eh...\xf000븁\x0000I bet you anything you'll\xffferun out of steam soon enough!
SO YOU BEAT THE\xfffeSUBWAY MASTERS TOO!\xf000븁\x0000SOMEDAY I WANT TO BE A HERO\xfffeTO THE UNOVA REGION
My precious, precious Poké Balls\xfffeare trembling violently...!\xf000븁\x0000You're not ordinary, are you?\xfffeA Champion somewhere, perhaps?
I feel great for having won so much,\xfffebut I've come an awfully long way...\xf000븁\x0000I hope I make it back in time\xfffefor work in the morning...
Finally, 49 in a row...\xf000븁\x0000If I could do my job this well,\xfffeI'd be promoted in no time!
You and I are both\xfffeat 100 in a row...\xf000븁\x0000I've got lotsa time to kill,\xfffeso I'm bettin' you do too.\xf000븁\x0000Take this as a commemoration of\xfffeour time-killing making-acquaintance!\xf000븁\x0000
I think that's a pretty valuable berry,\xfffebut I dunno how to use it\xf000븀\x0000as anything other than a snack.
It's a subway map of Unova.\xf000븁\x0000

I heard about these Pokémon statues\xfffeand came to investigate!\xf000븁\x0000
By the way, these statues are\xfffeactually Pokémon called Hihidaruma.\xf000븁\x0000They're currently asleep\xfffeand all hardened up.\xf000븁\x0000
As for how long they've existed,\xfffewell, a rough estimate...\xf000븁\x0000Like, wow! Over 2500 years ago!\xfffeThat seems to be\xf000븀\x0000when they fell asleep, at least.\xf000븁\x0000It's around the same era in which\xfffethis ruin, the Ancient Castle, was prosperous.\xf000븁\x0000Could it possibly be they\xfffeguarded the town?\xf000븁\x0000
These Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000They're in a state of contemplative sleep,\xfffeso if they wake up,\xf000븀\x0000they'll be active once more.\xf000븁\x0000And to wake up the Hihidaruma...\xfffeyou need this!\xf000븁\x0000A RageCandyBar!!\xf000븁\x0000That said, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffeI'll give one to you!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, I'll be heading back\xfffeto the Pokémon lab.\xf000븀\x0000Buh-byyye!!\xf000븁\x0000
A statue of\xfffean ancient Pokémon...?

Cheren: Halt, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000

The Pokémon in the Resort Desert took\xfffeup a surprising amount of my time...\xf000븁\x0000I've come this far\xfffethanks to my Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
...Adeku's gone ahead.\xfffeWe need to hurry, too.
Cheren: ...I'm not quite sure\xfffehow to say it.\xf000븁\x0000But I can't let this stand!\xf000븁\x0000

You're the first one who went\xfffeout of their way to talk to me!\xf000븁\x0000I'm delighted!\xfffeTake this!\xf000븁\x0000

Oh! A sea of sand!\xfffeBut you don't need Go-Goggles here!\xf000븁\x0000Oh, I came all the way\xfffefrom Hoenn, by the way!

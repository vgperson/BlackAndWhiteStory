Vio: You pansies...\xf000븁\x0000Bundle me up all you want,\xfffeI don't care about the cold...\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: ...Yeesh,\xfffethey were really hidden deep.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSuch a bother to do this in the cold...\xfffecould we possibly lead them outside?\xf000븁\x0000
Vio: We're holding onto Pokémon\xfffethat are friends of the king.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou won't bring\xfffeharm to them here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou, give those brats a beating!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Understood, Sage!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAlright, we're your opponents!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000! Let's split up\xfffeto take care of these guys!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000, you handle\xfffethe Plasma grunts over there!
Grunt: I can still be\xfffepretty strong in the cold!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: ...I'm shivering too much\xfffeto win in a place this freezing...
Grunt: ...I'm shivering too much\xfffeto win in a place this freezing...\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: I can be reeeeeal powerful in the cold!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: ...We were getting things together\xfffeto transport some stolen Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000We were assembled in front of\xfffethe freezer in the dead of night...\xf000븁\x0000And that old-timer Yacon\xfffesaw and caught us...

Grunt: I can be sorta good\xfffein the cold!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: ...Pokémon that work\xfffewith humans might look happy...\xf000븁\x0000But they're suffering, count on it!\xfffeNo doubt about it!
Grunt: ...Pokémon that work\xfffewith humans might look happy...\xf000븁\x0000But they're suffering, count on it!\xfffeNo doubt about it!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: I'm tough whether\xfffeI'm in the cold or not!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: ...Yawn... why am I\xfffefeeling kinda sleepy?
Grunt: ...Yawn... why am I\xfffefeeling kinda sleepy?\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: A-CHOO!\xfffeUh... as in, I'm sneezing AT YOU, foe!
Grunt: The difference between a\xffferegular container and a freezer is...\xf000븀\x0000pretty significant when you're running.
Grunt: ...! Am I really losing\xfffeto a trainer like THIS?!
Grunt: Ashooooo!\xffeWomen aren't built for this cold...
Yacon: Whoa there!\xf000븁\x0000So you were hidin' out in\xfffethis freezin' place, eh?\xf000븁\x0000
Take these Pokémon\xfffethieves away, boys!\xf000븁\x0000
Worker: Roger!!\xf000븁\x0000

Cheren: Whew...\xfffeTeam Plasma's logic, I tell you...\xf000븁\x0000They want to separate\xfffepeople from Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000Is that really any different from just\xffferidding the world of Pokémon entirely...?\xf000븀\x0000What an annoying bunch.\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xfffeIt's cold. Let's get outside.\xf000븁\x0000
Vio: ...You came back here?\xfffeWhat a curious trainer.\xf000븁\x0000Depending on exactly how curious,\xfffeperhaps I should talk a little?\xf000븁\x0000
...I breathe,\xfffeand my heart beats.\xf000븁\x0000...Is that really\xfffeall there is to life?\xf000븁\x0000I do not feel those actions\xfffealone to be living.\xf000븁\x0000
Feeling that you are alive\xfffethrough both joyous times\xf000븀\x0000and painful times is valuable.\xf000븁\x0000Lord Getis gave me\xfffethat perspective on living...\xf000븁\x0000What did I want?\xfffeSuch things did not matter.\xf000븁\x0000
I've been living here\xfffeand shivering away...\xf000븁\x0000
...Pokémon and humans both living\xfffeclose and depending on each other...\xf000븀\x0000perhaps that's what I feel living is.\xf000븁\x0000Then is releasing Pokémon\xfffenot so necessary after all...?\xf000븁\x0000In telling you these things, I've realized\xfffenew questions I should consider...\xf000븁\x0000As something of a\xfffethank you, take this.\xf000븁\x0000
Vio: Lord N said... that he\xfffewanted Pokémon to be made perfect.\xf000븁\x0000But even relating with humans\xfffeas they now do, perhaps Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000strive to be perfect regardless...\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Alright, then...\xfffeI'm an international policeman,\xf000븁\x0000so tell me what you know\xfffeabout Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000
Vio: It's too cold here...\xfffeI think I've shivered enough.\xf000븁\x0000If you give me some time to think,\xfffeI'll try to tell you something helpful.\xf000븀\x0000Okay, let's go.\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Thanks!\xf000븁\x0000Besides Getis, I guess this leaves\xfffe\xf000븀\x0000\xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the Seven Sages remaining...\xf000븁\x0000I want to know what they were\xfffethinking and hoping for...\xf000븀\x0000Well, see you again!\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Thanks!\xf000븁\x0000Okay, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xfffeThere's something I need to tell you.\xf000븁\x0000I've heard intel that, somewhere\xfffereally far away from here,\xf000븀\x0000there's been sighting of an N-ish person\xf000븀\x0000with a dragon Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000I'm going to go and see\xfffeif it's really true!\xf000븀\x0000Well, see you again someday!\xf000븁\x0000

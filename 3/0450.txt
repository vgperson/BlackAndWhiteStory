There are many people in the world.\xfffeAnd every one of those people\xf000븀\x0000has their own personality and ideas...\xf000븁\x0000When many can get together\xfffeto achieve great things,\xf000븀\x0000that makes me very happy.
When night falls, a big bad\xfffemonster comes out of the hole,\xf000븀\x0000so you better just come home!\xf000븁\x0000But, really...\xfffeIt's just a Pokémon, right?\xf000븀\x0000I'm certainly not scared!
On the route ahead, lovers of fishing\xfffespread across the coast!\xf000븁\x0000I'm busy, so I can't fish at night,\xfffebut there could be big catches...
My granny loves her old legends...\xfffeAnd they always take forever!\xf000븁\x0000Sometimes I wish\xfffeshe'd just play instead!
Ever since I got appointed here,\xfffeI haven't had to do a thing!\xf000븁\x0000I've had too much free time...\xfffeMy policing skills are getting rusty...
My Pokémon always go off\xfffeto play on their own...\xf000븁\x0000They're not like everybody else...
Goo-goon! Goo-goon!
Work sure is busy...\xfffeI only get to go home\xf000븀\x0000about once a week.\xf000븁\x0000I feel terrible making\xfffemy wife feel lonely,\xf000븀\x0000but that's the way it goes\xf000븀\x0000for a man like me...\xf000븁\x0000Oh, this is a souvenir\xfffeI got from a business trip.\xf000븀\x0000My wife doesn't seem to want it.\xf000븀\x0000You can have it.\xf000븁\x0000
I've got a business trip tomorrow.\xfffeWhew, I really am living\xf000븀\x0000the life of a businessman...

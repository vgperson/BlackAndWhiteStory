And that Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000
WHOA!\xf000븁\x0000
Makomo: I couldn't wait any longer,\xfffeso I just came anyway!\xf000븁\x0000And is it just me, or is that Musharna?!\xf000븁\x0000
Musharna: Mmmmn?
Munna: Mmn.
Makomo: What happened?\xf000븁\x0000
Belle: Oh, Makomo.\xf000븁\x0000Um, well, there was Munna...\xfffebut then some guys from Team Plasma\xf000븀\x0000came and kicked it...\xf000븁\x0000Then Musharna came... and then we saw\xfffesomething that might've been a dream?\xf000븀\x0000And then the Plasma guys ran, and...\xf000븁\x0000
Makomo: ...I see.\xf000븁\x0000Musharna is a Pokémon\xfffeevolved from Munna.\xf000븁\x0000It saw its friend Munna\xfffewas in a pickle,\xf000븁\x0000so it used its power to make a dream\xfffeinto reality and save Munna.\xf000븁\x0000...But, wait, hold up!\xf000븁\x0000
Isn't this Dream Smoke?!\xf000븁\x0000
Then with this,\xfffemy research is complete!\xf000븁\x0000Now, you two,\xfffecome back to my house!!\xf000븁\x0000
Belle: Whew... That was all...\xfffetotally hairy and stuff.\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffewould you go to Makomo's house?\xf000븁\x0000Me? I'm going to look for\xfffethat Pokémon we saw!\xf000븁\x0000
Belle: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffewould you go to Makomo's house?\xf000븁\x0000Me? I'm going to look for\xfffethat Pokémon we saw!
Ashura: Sha-WOW!\xf000븁\x0000
Did I scare you?!\xf000븁\x0000Skilled Pokémon trainer,\xfffedestroyer of our castle!\xf000븁\x0000I do believe\xfffeyou were scared!\xf000븁\x0000
Whenever Pokémon or people are scared,\xfffea little crack forms in their hearts.\xf000븁\x0000When that happens, they can't even\xfffeshow their most basic power.\xf000븁\x0000We revealed the castle,\xfffefound the legendary Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000brought fear to all people...\xf000븁\x0000Deep, deep in the cracks of their hearts,\xfffepeople felt Team Plasma's excellence, and\xf000븁\x0000the wonder of that coming new world.\xf000븁\x0000
But seeing you and the\xfffegym leaders' strong wills, I wonder\xf000븁\x0000how much virtue there\xfffeever was to that plan...?\xf000븁\x0000...Will that strength of heart be necessary\xfffeto lead Pokémon to the next stage...?\xf000븁\x0000Hrm... sorry for making you\xfffelisten to my rambling.\xf000븀\x0000You should take this.\xf000븁\x0000
Ashura: Lord N's dream... you were\xfffethe one who could put a stop to it.\xf000븀\x0000Please, don't ever forget that.\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Alright, then...\xfffeI'm an international policeman,\xf000븁\x0000so tell me what you know\xfffeabout Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000
Ashura: ...The Dream Smoke that\xfffecomes from the Musharna here...\xf000븁\x0000The dreams it shows are mere illusions.\xfffeBut that which comes true is a real dream...\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Thanks!\xf000븁\x0000Besides Geechisu, I guess this leaves\xfffe\xf000븀\x0000\xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the Seven Sages remaining...\xf000븁\x0000I want to know what they were\xfffethinking and hoping for...\xf000븀\x0000Well, see you again!\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Thanks!\xf000븁\x0000Okay, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xfffeThere's something I need to tell you.\xf000븁\x0000I've heard intel that, somewhere\xfffereally far away from here,\xf000븀\x0000there's been sighting of an N-ish person\xf000븀\x0000with a dragon Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000I'm going to go and see\xfffeif it's really true!\xf000븀\x0000Well, see you again someday!\xf000븁\x0000

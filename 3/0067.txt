Grunt: Hey, gramps!\xfffeSo you're a caretaker, huh?!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTeam Plasma\xfffeknows your needs!\xf000븁\x0000

Old Man: What nonsense!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh! Trainer, you look strong!\xfffeHelp me!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Get in the way, and\xfffewe'll take your Pokémon too!\xf000븁\x0000

Old Man: Thank you!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTake this as an\xfffeexpression of my gratitude!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was planning on riding this bike\xfffeto and from Nimbasa City, but...\xf000븀\x0000Well, I don't think I'll be\xf000븀\x0000doing that after all.\xf000븁\x0000
Old Man: I run a daycare\xfffeon Route 3!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf there's any Pokémon you want us to\xffferaise, feel free to leave them with us!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...Whew, coming here\xfffewas quite an experience!\xf000븁\x0000

Bianca: Heyyy! \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
I heard from the Professor\xfffethat Nimbasa City is\xf000븀\x0000loaded with attractions!\xf000븁\x0000It's like an amusement park!\xfffeThe Big Stadium, the Little Court...\xf000븁\x0000And the Battle Subway!\xf000븁\x0000
Me, I'm gonna go to the\xfffeMusical Hall! See you!!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Heyyy! \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Heyyy! \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
I was looking forward to the Musical Hall\xfffeearlier, and it's just AMAZING!\xf000븁\x0000Come on! You're here, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffeso you come too!\xf000븁\x0000Yeah!\xfffeThis way, this way!\xf000븁\x0000

Bianca: Oh, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000You're wondering about the musicals?\xfffeCome in with me!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Dad?!\xfffeWhy are you here?\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca's Dad: I came to take you\xfffeback home by any means necessary!\xf000븁\x0000I heard from your mother that\xfffeyou'd come this far...\xf000븀\x0000Isn't this enough for you?\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: No way!!\xf000븁\x0000I'm still on a journey with \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffeand with my Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca's Dad: It's pointless! Seeing new\xfffeplaces is one thing, but home is home!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Yeah? Well maybe I'm just me!\xfffeAnd you're just dad!\xf000븁\x0000
Young lady...\xfffeDo continue your journey.\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca's Dad: Excuse me! And who are\xfffeyou? This is a family matter!\xf000븁\x0000
Call me Elesa.\xf000븁\x0000I'm a model,\xfffeand this town's gym leader.\xf000븁\x0000
Naturally, the world is filled\xfffewith all kinds of people.\xf000븁\x0000And with people who don't think\xfffeat all like you do, there may be\xf000븀\x0000times when you feel hurt...\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca's Dad: That's right!\xf000븁\x0000Of course there are!\xfffeThat's why I'm so worried...\xf000븁\x0000
Elesa: However...\xf000븁\x0000As such things recur, the\xfffedifferences between you and others\xf000븀\x0000become simply natural,\xf000븀\x0000and you learn to value them.\xf000븁\x0000And though you worry, remember that\xfffethere will always be Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000to stand at a Trainer's side.\xf000븁\x0000They may appear merely cute,\xfffebut if you call for them,\xf000븀\x0000Pokémon are extremely dependable...\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: I'm begging you!\xf000븁\x0000I know there are things out there that\xfffeyou're right to worry about, dad...\xf000븀\x0000I know that!\xf000븁\x0000But...!\xfffeThere are really nice people, too!\xf000븁\x0000And by being with Pokémon,\xfffeI'll even get a little stronger!\xf000븀\x0000So... so...!\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca's Dad: ...Hrmm...\xf000븁\x0000......\xfffe......Well.\xf000븁\x0000I'd say it seems selfish of you to want\xfffeto continue your journey, Bianca, but...\xf000븁\x0000It's would be much more selfish\xfffeof me to force you to stop.\xf000븁\x0000Any way you slice it,\xfffeI'm the one being childish...\xf000븁\x0000
The gym leader has helped\xfffeme realize something.\xf000븁\x0000Yes, Bianca...\xfffeyou can very well\xf000븀\x0000do what you please, definitely.\xf000븁\x0000Dad will be praying that your journey\xfffeleads you to many worthwhile things.\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xfffeLook after Bianca for me.\xf000븁\x0000
Bianca: Dad...\xf000븁\x0000When I find what it is I want to do,\xfffeI'll be sure to come home!\xf000븁\x0000
Elesa: He, too, must have adventured\xfffeas a Trainer long ago...\xf000븀\x0000But it's tough being a parent.\xf000븁\x0000
Was I too nosy?\xf000븁\x0000I was a little bothered\xfffewhen I saw you arguing,\xf000븀\x0000so I sort of just stuck my head in...\xf000븁\x0000

Bianca: SO cool!\xf000븁\x0000I wish I could be as fantastic\xfffeas Miss Elesa!\xf000븁\x0000...Huh, I wonder\xfffewhat I could do?\xf000븁\x0000Well, before that, I've gotta find\xfffewhat it is I WANNA do!\xf000븀\x0000See you, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000

Iris: ...That one dragon Pokémon made a\xfffenew land together with twin heroes.\xf000븁\x0000And people and Pokémon\xfffelived their days happily!\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: But one day...\xf000븁\x0000The older of the two heroes\xfffesought the truth,\xf000븀\x0000and the younger sought the ideal.\xf000븁\x0000A dividing struggle began\xfffeto decide who was right...\xf000븁\x0000The single dragon that had\xfffewalked with the twins\xf000븀\x0000was also split into two\xf000븀\x0000to support both...\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: But one day...\xf000븁\x0000The older of the two heroes\xfffesought the truth,\xf000븀\x0000and the younger sought the ideal.\xf000븁\x0000A dividing struggle began\xfffeto decide who was right...\xf000븁\x0000The single dragon that had\xfffewalked with the twins\xf000븀\x0000was also split into two\xf000븀\x0000to support both...\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: A light dragon that searched\xfffethrough the world of the past\xf000븀\x0000for the truth...\xf000븁\x0000Its name was Reshiram.\xf000븁\x0000And another...\xf000븁\x0000A dark dragon that searched\xfffethrough the new, hopeful world\xf000븀\x0000for its ideal...\xf000븁\x0000Its name was Zekrom.\xf000븁\x0000

Shaga: The two being equal entities\xfffefrom the very start\xf000븀\x0000only made the quarrel more violent.\xf000븁\x0000Whichever side won, they would\xfffeend up absolutely exhausted...\xf000븁\x0000The twin heroes, too,\xfffecould not find either to be right\xf000븀\x0000in their struggle...\xf000븀\x0000So the struggle was ended...\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: And yet, yet, yet... the hero's\xfffesons began to struggle again...\xf000븁\x0000So Reshiram and Zekrom\xfffeused their flames and lightning\xf000븀\x0000to eradicate Isshu in an instant...\xf000븁\x0000But if people hadn't been mistaken\xfffeabout how to get along with Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000the world wouldn't have been destroyed!\xf000븁\x0000So Reshiram and Zekrom did their best\xfffefor everyone and made a new land!\xf000븁\x0000And so so so...!\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: And yet, yet, yet... the hero's\xfffesons began to struggle again...\xf000븁\x0000So Zekrom and Reshiram\xfffeused their lightning and flames\xf000븀\x0000to eradicate Isshu in an instant...\xf000븁\x0000But if people hadn't been mistaken\xfffeabout how to get along with Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000the world wouldn't have been destroyed!\xf000븁\x0000So Zekrom and Reshiram did their best\xfffefor everyone and made a new land!\xf000븁\x0000And so so so...!\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: ...I'm certain Pokémon\xfffedon't need possessions.\xf000븁\x0000As people continue having\xfffetheir own thoughts on Pokémon,\xf000븀\x0000some of them may be hateful...\xf000븁\x0000But even so!\xf000븁\x0000It is necessary for Pokémon and people\xfffeto believe in each other\xf000븀\x0000to continue living...\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Yow, that's right!!\xf000븁\x0000And so so sooo!\xfffeWe just CAN'T let Team Plasma\xf000븀\x0000separate us from our Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: ...I'm sorry, that last part\xfffewas a bit off-topic.\xf000븁\x0000But that's all\xfffewe can tell you.\xf000븁\x0000Unfortunately, we know nothing\xfffeabout how to awaken\xf000븀\x0000the legendary dragon Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: ...Well, I made\xfffea promise to Adeku.\xf000븁\x0000You'll have to come get\xfffethe Souryuu gym badge.\xf000븁\x0000
So, Iris...\xf000븁\x0000Face off against \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000\xfffeat the Pokémon gym.\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: You BET!!\xf000븁\x0000Watch out, 'cause I'm just as big\xfffeof a doozy as Uncle Shaga!\xf000븁\x0000
Well then, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xf000븁\x0000I await your challenge\xfffeat the Pokémon gym!\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: ...How would our world of people\xfffeand Pokémon co-existing be perfectly split...?\xf000븁\x0000As they are now, everything is allowed\xfffeto intermingle with everthing else.\xf000븁\x0000I believe that makes for\xfffean abundance in ways of thinking.
Iris: It's great when everyone can\xfffeget along, Pokémon and humans!

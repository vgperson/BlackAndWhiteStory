Welcome!\xfffeThis is Nacrene Museum.
Those thieves... Team Plasma...\xfffeJust what are they supposed to be?
The Pokémon gym\xfffeis further into the museum!
I wonder what they're planning\xfffethat they'd steal the Dragon Skull?
Hmm! Every time I behold this skeleton...\xfffeit's simply charming!\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, hello.\xfffeI'm the vice-curator, Kidachi.\xf000븁\x0000You've come a long way. Allow me\xfffeto guide you around the building!\xf000븁\x0000
This skeleton...\xfffeIt's from a dragon-type Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000Perhaps there was some form of\xfffedisaster while it still roamed the lands,\xf000븀\x0000leaving it to fossilize like so.\xf000븁\x0000
This is an impressive stone.\xfffeIt's a meteorite!\xf000븁\x0000It would appear to contain\xfffesome kind of mystical space energy.\xf000븁\x0000
Ah, this is...\xfffejust a plain old stone.\xf000븁\x0000It was found in the desert,\xfffebut the only value it has going\xf000븀\x0000for it is that it's old...\xf000븁\x0000But it's quite pretty,\xfffeso we put it up on display.\xf000븁\x0000
Beyond here, the museum\xfffebecomes a Pokémon gym.\xf000븁\x0000
Furthest in, you'll find the strong,\xfffeyet kind gym leader awaiting.\xf000븁\x0000Oh... and by the way,\xfffegym leader Lenora is my wife.\xf000븁\x0000
Furthest in, you'll find the strong,\xfffeyet kind gym leader awaiting.\xf000븁\x0000Oh... and by the way,\xfffegym leader Lenora is my wife.
Lenora: Hold up, you!\xfffeStop foolin' around!!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Oh, you came, gym leader?\xf000븁\x0000We're going to take this Dragon Skull\xfffefor our cause of liberating Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: And to show you we're serious,\xfffewe'll do it right before your eyes!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Alright! Smokescreen!\xf000븁\x0000
Plasmaaaaa!

Lenora: What in the name of...\xf000븁\x0000
Kidachi: Uh... uh?!\xfffeWe've got to chase them down!\xf000븁\x0000
Kidachi: Lenora really loves that skull...
Bianca: I can't let these\xfffejerk thieves get away with this!!
Cheren: Great, so Team Plasma's keeping\xfffeus from fighting the gym leader...?\xf000븁\x0000Just my luck... what a pain.
Fossil specimens\xfffeare truly wondrous...\xf000븁\x0000Normally, the bare-bones design is\xfffefunctionally invisible from the outside.\xf000븁\x0000It brings new meaning to the\xfffenotion of something's true nature...\xf000븀\x0000how fascinating.
Rarities gathered from the world over...\xfffeMuseums are truly enchanting!
Whoaaaaa! AHHHHH!
The gym leader here also does\xffferesearch in fossils and Pokémon bones!
The sheer audacity of these thieves...\xf000븁\x0000They really do seem to believe\xfffethat what they're doing is just.
Do you think any Pokémon might have\xfffecome from space, along with meteorites?
What are those fools\xfffein Team Plasma THINKING?!

The skull stolen by Team Plasma\xfffeis still missing!!

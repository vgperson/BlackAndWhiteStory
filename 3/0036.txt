Cheren: Hey, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000I just challenged the\xfffegym leader Arty.\xf000븁\x0000
He's definitely quite the gym leader...\xf000븁\x0000I got the badge, but it was\xfffehonestly pretty tricky.\xf000븁\x0000Well, not like I was going to have\xfffeany problems with bug types, anyway.\xf000븁\x0000
I'm going to keep beating\xfffeall the gym leaders in Unova.\xf000븁\x0000Then I'll head for the Pokémon\xfffeLeague and beat the Champion!\xf000븁\x0000Once I do that, everyone'll recognize\xfffeme as a powerful Trainer...\xf000븁\x0000I really feel that's\xfffewhat I'm living for...\xf000븁\x0000
Arty: Oho?\xf000븁\x0000You... Yes, you fought Team Plasma\xfffein Yaguruma Forest...\xf000븁\x0000And I believe your name was...\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000Perhaps you're here\xfffeto challenge my gym?\xf000븁\x0000
Arty: Oho?\xf000븁\x0000You... Yes, you fought Team Plasma\xfffein Yaguruma Forest...\xf000븁\x0000And I believe your name was...\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000Perhaps you're here\xfffeto challenge my gym?\xf000븁\x0000
Aww... er, I know it's awful of me,\xfffebut could you wait a little longer?\xf000븁\x0000I've heard word that\xfffeTeam Plasma is in town!\xf000븁\x0000You need to come too!\xfffeHead to Prime Pier!!\xf000븁\x0000
Arty: ...\xf000븁\x0000There's no doubt,\xfffethis is the place.\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Nope, sorry!\xf000븁\x0000There's no Plasma members\xfffeor Sages in here!\xf000븁\x0000You think I'm lying?\xfffeWanna fight about it?
Grunt: ...Hmph.\xfffeNow scram!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Grrr!\xf000븁\x0000I'll take this weakling,\xfffeso you two go for\xf000븀\x0000the strong one over there!\xf000븁\x0000
Pokémon are worked to their limit by\xfffeweak Trainers! Think about how THEY feel!
Get it?\xfffeSo we take people's Pokémon!!
Arty: ...The nerve!\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffeyou take care of them!\xf000븁\x0000
Arty: ...The nerve!\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffeyou take care of them!\xf000븁\x0000
Arty: ...It seems battling is the\xfffeonly way we're getting in.
Grunt: This is bad...\xf000븁\x0000This is awful, terrible,\xfffeworst, worst, worst!\xf000븁\x0000Team Plasma's been smashed again!\xfffePlasmashed, you could say!\xf000븁\x0000We'll have to report back\xfffeto the Sage for now...!\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: ...Whew, I got lost.\xf000븁\x0000Even trying to work out directions over\xfffeLive Caster, it's all moonspeak to me!\xf000븁\x0000
Arty: Team Plasma is right here.\xf000븁\x0000So maybe the Pokémon\xfffethey stole will be, too!\xf000븀\x0000Okay, I'm going in!\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Alrighty!\xfffeI'm fighting too this time!\xf000븀\x0000Hey, and missy Belle, too!\xf000븁\x0000
Belle: H-Hold up, though...\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000, you need to come too!\xf000븁\x0000
The Live Caster is ringing.
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 connected\xfffeto the Live Caster.\xf000븁\x0000
What the gym leader is looking for is\xfffea bond between the challenger and\xf000븀\x0000their Pokémon... a definite relationship!
Before you challenge the gym,\xfffeask yourself: do I have enough Potions?\xf000븀\x0000And make SURE you're sure that you do!
As Pokémon Trainers, no one\xfffehas a reason to become stronger.\xf000븁\x0000But loving your Pokémon\xfffeand playing together with them...\xf000븀\x0000That's something everyone can do.
My bag has six Poké Balls! More than\xfffeenough to catch anything with moves!\xf000븁\x0000...Okay, actually, I'd like some\xfffeGreat Balls and Ultra Balls...\xf000븁\x0000But unless I get more gym badges,\xfffethe Friendly Shop won't sell me any.
My Pokémon are just the kyootest!\xf000븁\x0000When I come home totally beat,\xfffethey're always there to refresh me!

Hi, Trainer! Do you know a Pokémon\xfffecalled Audino?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's a Pokémon that I sometimes find\xfffewhen I'm walking.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt jumps out of rustling grass.\xfffeI can get a lot of Exp. Points.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's kind of a friendly Pokémon, isn't it?
I heard that the Fossils in the museum\xfffewere found in Twist Mountain.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThen, a person called Clay apparently\xfffedonated them to the museum.
When you choose “HELP"\xfffeat the PC at a Pokémon Center,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou can learn many things. It's so cool!

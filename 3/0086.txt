I cheer for the one\xfffewho scores the points!\xf000븁\x0000Making a team means\xfffeassigning respective duties!
The game of football...\xfffeIt's split into the attack, or offense...\xf000븀\x0000And the guard, or defense...\xf000븀\x0000It's such an enjoyable sport!
His eyes...\xf000븁\x0000I know they're fixed on me...\xf000븁\x0000This is my proudest moment!
A football helmet and protective gear\xfffeweighs about 15 pounds or so!
I always train myself\xfffeby tackling my Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000Nothing will faze me!
Yes!\xfffeWith Protect and Detect,\xf000븀\x0000my defense is impregnable!

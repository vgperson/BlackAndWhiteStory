Geechisu: So this is the\xfffegym leader Arti...\xf000븁\x0000
Arti: Team Plasma...\xfffeAre you the ones stealing\xf000븀\x0000ほwhat you want from people?\xf000븁\x0000
Sumura: Hiding out in plain sight near\xfffehis gym seemed like an interesting idea,\xf000븀\x0000but it sure let him\xf000븀\x0000find us quickly...\xf000븁\x0000
Geechisu: Quite so...\xf000븁\x0000Well, we've already established\xfffea magnificent hideout.\xf000븁\x0000Now,\xfffeare you familiar with the\xf000븀\x0000legend of Isshu's formation?\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Yeah, I know that! The one\xfffewith the white dragon Pokémon, right?!\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Yeah, I know that! The one\xfffewith the black dragon Pokémon, right?!\xf000븁\x0000
Geechisu: Correct...\xfffeHow can a world with so many\xf000븀\x0000countries arguing be put to order...?\xf000븁\x0000There was a hero who\xfffepondered over that idea.\xf000븁\x0000And a white dragon Pokémon\xfffewho turned its fangs on\xf000븀\x0000those who defied it...\xf000븁\x0000The hero and the Pokémon\xfffeused their power to bring\xf000븀\x0000order to the hearts\xf000븀\x0000of all by creating Isshu.\xf000븁\x0000
Geechisu: Correct...\xfffeHow can a world with so many\xf000븀\x0000countries arguing be put to order...?\xf000븁\x0000There was a hero who\xfffepondered over that idea.\xf000븁\x0000And a black dragon Pokémon\xfffewho turned its fangs on\xf000븀\x0000those who defied it...\xf000븁\x0000The hero and the Pokémon\xfffeused their power to bring\xf000븀\x0000order to the hearts\xf000븀\x0000of all by creating Isshu.\xf000븁\x0000
And once more! The hero and the\xfffePokémon shall be revived here\xf000븀\x0000in Isshu to capture people's hearts!\xf000븁\x0000A remarkably simple desire\xfffeof mine... rather,\xf000븀\x0000of Team Plasma's!\xf000븁\x0000
Arti: There are many people\xfffehere in Hiun City...\xf000븁\x0000Their lifestyles and ways of\xfffethinking are all incredibly diverse.\xf000븁\x0000So honestly, what are you saying? 'Cause\xfffeI really think you're missing something.
Huh?
Like what?
Arti: But everyone shares a\xfffesimilarity in one respect:\xf000븀\x0000their valuing of Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000We communicate with even our\xfffeclosest friends through Pokémon!\xf000븀\x0000Through battling or trading...\xf000븁\x0000
Oh, about the speech at Karakusa?\xf000븁\x0000I'm thankful that you gave me\xfffea chance to reconsider what it\xf000븀\x0000meant to get along with Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000And so I swore...!\xf000븁\x0000I would earnestly stand\xfffeface to face with Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000But what you're doing isn't exactly\xfffestrengthening the bonds between\xf000븀\x0000people and Pokémon, now is it?\xf000븁\x0000
Geechisu: Wahahaha!\xf000븁\x0000Don't think of it as\xfffeseizing so much as dividing.\xf000븁\x0000I have plenty of good sense.\xfffeAnd I love humans, really.\xf000븁\x0000After all, our king has brought\xfffetogether we Seven Sages to be an\xf000븀\x0000assembly of wisdom from all nations.\xf000븁\x0000Very well! For now, I'll\xfffeleave you to your opinion...\xf000븁\x0000
That girl over there...\xfffeGive her back her Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Bel: Th-Thank you!\xf000븁\x0000Munna! Welcome back!\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Missy!!\xf000븁\x0000Don't you see how villainous these guys\xfffeare for taking people's beloved Pokémon?!\xf000븁\x0000
Bel: Y-Yeah... But I'm just\xfffeso happy Munna is safe...\xf000븁\x0000
Geechisu: What a beautiful sight!\xfffeFellowship between man and Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000But we must still liberate\xfffePokémon from foolish humans.\xf000븁\x0000And for that purpose, we must re-enact\xfffethe legend to change people's hearts...\xf000븁\x0000Well then, take care...\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: And why exactly did you\xfffelet those scoundrels go?!\xf000븁\x0000
Arti: ...Hrm.\xf000븁\x0000What else could we do,\xfffegiven the stolen\xf000븀\x0000Pokémon at stake?\xf000븁\x0000
Bel: It's all right!\xfffeThank you, Iris!\xf000븀\x0000Nobody got hurt or anything.\xf000븁\x0000More than anything, it's just about\xfffemeeting my precious Pokémon again!\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Awright...\xfffeI guess it's fine, then...\xf000븁\x0000
Arti: So, what will\xfffeyou all do now?\xf000븁\x0000
Bel: ...I kinda wanna look\xfffearound Hiun City, but, uh...\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: You're in luck!1\xf000븁\x0000Don't worry, I'll keep bein'\xfffeyour bodyguard, missy Belle!!\xf000븁\x0000
Bel: Oh, Iris...\xf000븁\x0000
Arti: Hm, alright.\xf000븁\x0000Iris is an extraordinary Pokémon\xfffetrainer, although she doesn't\xf000븀\x0000care much for this city.\xf000븁\x0000But anyway, people and Pokémon need to help\xfffeeach other! Cooperation and all that!!\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Oh, and you, good sir!\xf000븁\x0000Thanks for lookin' for the\xfffePokémon! Take this!\xf000븁\x0000

And in serving as parents, the trio\xfffetaught it the knowledge and skills\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit would need to survive...\xf000븁\x0000
The young Pokémon matured quickly,\xfffeand acquired power that rivaled\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe trio that had raised it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHowever...\xfffeEventually, the young Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffevanished from the forest.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNo one knew why, but myself...\xfffeI think it is only natural of youth\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeto yearn for reckless adventure...\xf000븁\x0000
I see their joy at being able\xfffeto meet again after so long...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePerhaps the trio have something\xfffethey wish to teach Keldeo...?\xf000븁\x0000

When you wish to teach Keldeo,\xfffebring Cobalon, Terrakion, and Virizion.\xf000븁\x0000
A rich forest and clear water...\xfffeTo Pokémon, this forest\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis like a paradise.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's very important for people, too.\xfffeWe should seek to preserve it...

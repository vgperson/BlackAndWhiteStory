The Pokémon ran up the rock wall\xfffeand vanished somewhere in the cave...
The strength you have demonstrated in\xfffesharing your heart with your Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehas been displayed to Cobalon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWhen you and your Pokémon\xfffehave trained to be stronger still,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffereturn here again.\xf000븁\x0000
Through you, Cobalon seems to have\xffferealized that the world has changed\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeinto one where people and Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffelive helping each other...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCobalon seems to desire\xfffeto live together with you.\xf000븁\x0000
If Cobalon's heart was softened\xfffethrough fighting you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTerrakion and Virizion, whom he\xfffeshares a strong bond with,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeshould also know soon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI think they, too,\xfffewill want to evaluate your heart.\xf000븁\x0000
The obstacles keeping people\xfffeaway from Terrakion and Virizion\xf000븀\x0000should be gone now.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFinding them, however,\xfffeis up to you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut they are undoubtedly\xfffeawaiting you...\xf000븁\x0000
I see you're quite\xfffeskillful for your age...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffePerhaps you could...\xfffehrm...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's a possibility, I suppose...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell? Will you lend your ears to\xfffethis old man's ancient story?
It was long ago, when people and Pokémon\xfffelived in their own separate worlds...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThrough a war humans started,\xfffea forest in which Pokémon lived\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewas engulfed in flames.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe Pokémon could not escape\xfffethrough the fire and smoke...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere then appeared the legendary\xfffeCobalon, Terrakion, and Virizion!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTerrakion used its sheer strength\xfffeto destroy the boulders blocking escape.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeVirizion made use of its swiftness\xfffeto protect Pokémon from the sparks.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd Cobalon guided the frightened\xfffePokémon out of the forest.\xf000븁\x0000
Cobalon, Terrakion, and Virizion\xfffefought away the warring parties\xf000븀\x0000with overwhelming strength.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe parties, frightful of\xfffethe power the three showed,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeat last put an end to their war...\xf000븁\x0000
If people do not cease fighting,\xfffePokémon can have no peace.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe trio knew that people's deeds\xfffecould cause the loss of many lives...\xf000븁\x0000
To avoid contact with people,\xfffethey went away to places unknown...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSince then, the three\xfffehave almost never been seen,\xf000븀\x0000and they thus turned to legend...\xf000븁\x0000
I have been searching for them\xfffefor countless years on end...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd at last, I have ascertained there\xfffeto be one deep in this cave.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut the legendary trio\xfffehas no trust in humans.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf a person draws near,\xfffethey will bare their fangs and attack.\xf000븁\x0000
They only know the world as it was\xfffeso long ago, so it cannot be helped...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThey remain ignorant of the fact\xfffethat our world has become\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeone of people and Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeunderstanding and helping each other.\xf000븁\x0000
Perhaps if you could make them\xffferealize that people and Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000can live together in trust...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeEven they could choose to live with people\xfffeif given a reason to reconsider them...\xf000븁\x0000
It is not just about people and Pokémon...\xfffeLiving creatures of all kinds\xf000븀\x0000\xffferespecting and believing each other\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis most imperative...
If you can't obediently\xfffelisten to the elderly,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeI have no hope for you...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis is not a place you belong!\xfffeTake your leave!\xf000븁\x0000

My Pokémon always go off\xfffeto play on their own...\xf000븁\x0000But it's okay, since they usually\xfffecome back before nightfall.
Goo-googoo...
This is Kagome Town...\xf000븁\x0000Where people live properly\xfffefrom good morning to good night...
When night falls, a big bad\xfffemonster comes out of the hole,\xf000븀\x0000so you better just come home!

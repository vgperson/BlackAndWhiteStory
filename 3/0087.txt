If you want to get good at anything,\xfffeyou gotta do it day after day,\xf000븀\x0000and the day after that!\xf000븁\x0000If you don't,\xfffeyou won't get results!
I used to play catch with Poké Balls\xfffeback when I was a runt...
Becoming an adult\xfffeisn't so bad...\xf000븁\x0000As long as you don't forget\xfffethe way you felt as a kid!
I have my baseball,\xfffeI have my Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000How could I be happier?!
If you don't swing,\xfffeyou won't hit!\xf000븁\x0000You might never mess up,\xfffebut you'll never succeed either!
I always pitch with ALL my might!\xfffeIt's the only kind of might I can give!
I pride myself on my bat!

Sometimes, above the bridge, you can\xfffesee the shadows of bird Pokémon, right?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTheir feathers drift to the ground here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd when you try to pick them up,\xfffeoccasionally, you'll run into a Pokémon.
When a ship passes, the bridge raises\xfffeand lowers.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut Clay controls when the ships run\xfffefrom the start, so when the bridge\xf000븀\x0000\xffferaises and lowers is up to Clay.
When Driftveil is mentioned, what comes\xfffeto mind is the Cold Storage...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand Charles!

You know you can sometimes see the\xfffeshadows of bird Pokémon on the bridge?\xf000븀\x0000Sometimes their feathers fall below!\xf000븁\x0000And sometimes, while gathering them,\xfffeI accidentally bump into Pokémon!
The drawbridge raises and lowers\xfffeevery time a ship passes through.\xf000븁\x0000Of course, Mr. Yacon decides\xfffethe way the ships move...\xf000븁\x0000Meaning he effectively controls\xfffethe bridge raising and lowering!
When you say "Hodomoe,"\xfffeI think of the freezer storage...\xf000븀\x0000and Charles!!

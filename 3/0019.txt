I'm partial to fire-type Pokémon,\xfffeso they're the only ones I train.\xf000븁\x0000But I don't stand a chance\xfffeagainst water-type Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000Huh... maybe I should train\xfffesome other types, too? Eh.
Training six Pokémon all at once\xfffecan be a major hassle.\xf000븁\x0000Some trainers can be strong\xfffeby only focusing on three or so.

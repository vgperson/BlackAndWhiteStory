I've trained only Fire-type Pokémon,\xfffe'cause they're my favorites!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut they had no chance in a battle\xfffeagainst Water-type Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSigh... Maybe I should try to train\xfffePokémon of other types.
It is quite hard to train six Pokémon at\xfffeonce, so I've heard some Trainers focus\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeon training three Pokémon at a time.

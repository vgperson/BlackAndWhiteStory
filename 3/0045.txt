Yanapuu, Baoppu, and Hiyappu...\xfffeThese three Pokémon evolve\xf000븀\x0000with the use of special stones!\xf000븁\x0000Which of those Pokémon\xfffedo you want to evolve?
Yanappu...\xfffeThen you'll need a Leaf Stone.\xf000븁\x0000
Baoppu...\xfffeThen you'll need a Fire Stone.\xf000븁\x0000
Hiyappu...\xfffeThen you'll need a Water Stone.\xf000븁\x0000
I don't know if you already knew this,\xfffebut here's some advice!\xf000븁\x0000If you evolve your Pokémon,\xfffeit'll get stronger, but it'll also be\xf000븀\x0000harder for it to learn moves.\xf000븁\x0000It's especially a problem for\xfffePokémon that evolve with stones.\xf000븁\x0000It's best to use a stone after the\xfffePokémon has learned some good moves.\xf000븁\x0000And as soon as you evolve it,\xfffeperhaps you could use some TMs?\xf000븀\x0000I leave it up to you!
Yanappu
Baoppu
Hiyappu
Quit
Yanappu, huh?
Baoppu, huh?
Hiyappu, huh?
Well then...\xfffeYanapuu, Baoppu, and Hiyappu...\xf000븀\x0000Which do you want to evolve?
Oh, all right.\xf000븁\x0000I know it can be hard to decide.\xfffeWhen you've chosen, talk to me again!
Stick your thumb upward,\xfffeand clench the rest of your fingers...\xf000븁\x0000That's the "thumbs up" pose!\xfffeIt means "okay!" or "good!"

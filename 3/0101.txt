Cheren: ...What a pain.\xf000븁\x0000Well, I'm thankful you\xfffelet the bridge down for us...\xf000븀\x0000er, but that's unrelated, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000
Yacon: No way, son.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt was important that ya came here...\xfffesure, it meant lettin' Team Plasma\xf000븀\x0000into town, but so be it.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI was just thinkin' this to myself,\xfffebut y'oughta search out Plasma too.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeYer real go-getter trainers, ain't ya?\xf000븁\x0000
Right...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnce ya find Team Plasma,\xfffecome challenge me at the gym!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeLife's a give and take!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: Understood.\xf000븁\x0000He didn't have to tell us so,\xfffebut we'll search for Team Plasma.\xf000븁\x0000They're a tedious lot to beat\xfffeagain and again, but at least\xf000븀\x0000it makes us stronger, I suppose...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeI'll go on ahead.\xf000븁\x0000
Getis: Hello, Mr. Yacon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI am Getis\xfffeof Team Plasma.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI see you've taken care of\xfffesome of my own.\xf000븁\x0000
Yacon: Oh, no need ta thank me.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYer members were\xfffestealin' Pokémon, after all.\xf000븁\x0000
Getis: Oh? I think there's been\xfffea misunderstanding.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe are merely freeing\xfffePokémon from evil people.\xf000븁\x0000
Yacon: You really goin' with that?\xf000븁\x0000Honestly, I ain't too good\xfffewith words...\xf000븁\x0000And on the other hand,\xfffeyou're pretty fancy with 'em...\xf000븀\x0000but they reek of a liar.\xf000븁\x0000So what d'ya mean ta say?\xf000븁\x0000
Getis: Team Plasma has\xfffean interest in Hodomoe City.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are many people who are\xfffeonly to be found here...\xf000븁\x0000
Yacon: ...Not sure if that's\xfffea lie or truth, but...\xf000븁\x0000It's always best ta come to a\xfffevictory without havin' to fight it.\xf000븁\x0000Hmph! Awright.\xfffeTake 'em back, fine!\xf000븁\x0000
Getis: Just as I expected from the\xfffeone they call King of the Hills...\xf000븁\x0000A magnificent decision-maker, indeed.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeNow... Allow me to speak\xfffewith that Sage there...\xf000븁\x0000
Vio: Lord Getis...\xfffeThank you so very much...\xf000븁\x0000
Getis: Oh, it's fine.\xf000븁\x0000We're working for the king together...\xfffeAre we not both Sages?\xf000븁\x0000Well then, everyone.\xfffeWhatever day we might meet again...\xf000븁\x0000
Yacon: You found them rotten\xfffeTeam Plasma guys and all, but ugh...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWell, gotta pull myself together.\xfffeLet's get ta our Pokémon battle!\xf000븀\x0000Don't make me wait, now!\xf000븁\x0000
Cheren: ...Are both of them looking\xfffeto prevent quarrel in the town?\xf000븁\x0000Either way, I don't feel that Getis\xfffefellow to be any ordinary person.\xf000븁\x0000...Well, I'll be\xfffetraining my Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000I don't want to lose\xfffeto Yacon one bit!\xf000븁\x0000I'll take the gym badge\xfffeafter a flawless victory!\xf000븁\x0000
When the drawbridge raises or lowers,\xfffeeverybody takes notice!\xf000븁\x0000...Which is what gave Team Plasma\xfffethe chance to run.\xf000븁\x0000They weren't seen near the bridge,\xfffeso they're somewhere in town...
Mr. Yacon is the gym leader,\xfffebut he's in the midst of business.\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeCome back again later.

I cook together vegetables\xfffeto make delicious soup!
When I'm cooking,\xfffeI don't have to talk...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt's an easy life for me!

There's a Pokémon in Isshu that\xfffecauses thunderstorms like these\xf000븀\x0000\xfffenamed Voltolos...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt flies around, making the sky rumble\xfffewith dreadful wind and thunder!\xf000븁\x0000

Come now, drink up!\xf000븁\x0000

Rainstorms ruin my\xfffecarefully-grown crops!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSuch a bothersome Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
When I think I've caught it,\xfffeit flies off to who knows where!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeWhen I think I've found it,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit runs away immediately...\xf000븁\x0000
It takes one day for it to\xfffemake one lap around Isshu.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSouth towns in the morning,\xfffenorth ones at night...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo it comes here\xfffearound evening!
It seems somebody out there\xfffetold that Pokémon what for!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeCould it have been\xfffethat other Pokémon?
I, a handsome man,\xfffeand granny, a lively lady!\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeThat's how it used to be...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd we punished that Pokémon prankster\xfffeVoltolos for causing thunderstorms.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor nearly thirty years since,\xfffeVoltolos has been docile,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffebut it seems it was hiding here...

When walking on a stormy route,\xfffeit might come out of the grass.
There's a Pokémon that punishes\xfffeVoltolos for its mischief...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI believe it's said... that Pokémon\xffferesides in a shrine near Route 14...

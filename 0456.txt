???: Oh...?\xf000븁\x0000
How... familiar...\xf000븁\x0000I never expected to meet a Pokémon trainer\xfffewith the same eyes as that one,\xf000븀\x0000and especially not in a place like this...\xf000븁\x0000What's your name...?\xf000븁\x0000... ... ...\xfffe... ... ...\xf000븁\x0000\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000, then.\xfffeI'll be sure to remember it!\xf000븁\x0000I am Cynthia.\xf000븁\x0000I'm just a curious Pokémon trainer\xfffeinvestigating the myths of Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
There are underwater ruins\xfffehere in Sazanami Town, you know.\xf000븁\x0000As such, I borrowed a villa\xfffefrom an acquaintance of mine.\xf000븁\x0000
Now, in order to make a deep\xfffeacquaintance with a fellow Pokémon trainer...\xf000븁\x0000I would like us to have\xfffea bout with our Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000Would you be my opponent?
Before I send out my Pokémon,\xfffemy chest always throbs...\xf000븁\x0000It is filled with the joyous feelings\xfffeof the Pokémon inside their Pokéballs.\xf000븁\x0000So, what manner of trainer are you?\xf000븁\x0000
Ohoho.\xfffeA... most composed decision.\xf000븁\x0000When you are prepared, I would be\xfffedelighted if you return and say so!
Cynthia: Oh?\xfffeSo you've made your preparations.\xf000븁\x0000I would like us to havexfffea bout with our Pokémon...\xf000븀\x0000Would you be my opponent?
Cynthia: How admirable!\xfffeThat was a magnificent battle.\xf000븁\x0000...Yes, familiar indeed.\xf000븁\x0000Like hat trainer\xfffethat faced down Giratina...\xf000븁\x0000Hm. I won't bore you\xfffewith my own story.\xf000븁\x0000I also have much\xfffeto investigate in Sinnoh\xf000븁\x0000come spring and summer...\xf000븁\x0000I would be overjoyed if you\xfffewould come see me again,\xf000븀\x0000most wonderful of Pokémon trainers!
Cynthia: I also have much\xfffeto investigate in Sinnoh\xf000븁\x0000come spring and summer...\xf000븁\x0000I would be overjoyed if you\xfffewould come see me again,\xf000븀\x0000most wonderful of Pokémon trainers!
Cynthia: Oh, you came!\xf000븁\x0000I may seem hurried, but I wish\xfffeto battle my Pokemon against yours...\xf000븀\x0000Would you be my opponent?
Cynthia: Thank you!\xfffeNow, I shall face you with all my might!\xf000븁\x0000
Cynthia: Ah, that's a shame...\xf000븁\x0000In summer, the vibes of vacation\xfffehere in Sazanami Town\xf000븀\x0000make me forgot all about battling...\xf000븁\x0000But in spring, my feelings surmount,\xfffeand I grow a desire to battle.
Cynthia: I wish to battle\xfffemy Pokemon against yours...\xf000븀\x0000Would you be my opponent?
Cynthia: It brings back memories...\xf000븁\x0000In going to more and more places,\xfffeI want to meet all kinds of people\xf000븀\x0000and all kinds of Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000That's something I've said both to you,\xfffeand to a trainer just like you.\xf000븁\x0000I certainly think it great\xfffethat I traveled to distant Isshu.\xf000븁\x0000For in meeting you,\xfffemy world has expanded!
Cynthia: ...Pokémon and people\xfffecan have their lives brightened \xf000븁\x0000when they challenge a powerful opponent\xfffewith utter devotion.\xf000븁\x0000So, I, too would like to\xfffebattle with you. Do you accept?
Cynthia: Via each of our beloved Pokémon,\xfffeI shall know more about you!\xf000븁\x0000
Cynthia: ...I'm a bit let down.\xf000븁\x0000After all, my battling with you\xfffewas of the highest caliber!\xf000븁\x0000Both our lives should be\xfffeever brightened as such...
Cynthia: How about it?\xf000븁\x0000I would like you battle you\xfffewith all my might, so that it may\xf000븀\x0000brighten up my life. Do you accept?
Cynthia: When you oppose a trainer, \xfffebattle allows you to understand\xf000븀\x0000what manner of person they are.\xf000븁\x0000What Pokémon do they use,\xfffeand what moves do they know?\xf000븀\x0000What items do they possess?\xf000븀\x0000Words are meaningless then...\xf000븁\x0000So! If you wish to know more about me,\xfffeI implore you to come to the Sinnoh region!
Caitlin: Things always turning out the way\xfffeyou like is a precedent to unhappiness.\xf000븁\x0000There are things I can\xfffeand cannot do.\xf000븀\x0000Recognizing that is key.\xf000븁\x0000There was an annoying person\xfffewho said that long ago...
Caitlin: ...No matter what,\xfffeI can't defeat Cynthia.\xf000븁\x0000Perhaps in the past,\xfffeI would have exploded with rage.\xf000븁\x0000But now, I calmly\xfffereview the battle, and consider\xf000븀\x0000how I can become stronger.
Caitlin: ...Are you familiar with\xfffethe Battle Castles?\xf000븁\x0000One exists in Johto and Sinnoh,\xfffeso if you like, go and challenge them.
Caitlin: ...This is a villa of mine.\xf000븁\x0000I have them all over the world,\xfffeso I allow Cynthia to use this one.\xf000븁\x0000You're free to play here\xfffeif you wish, as well.
Caitlin: ...If you possess\xfffeuncontrollable psychic ability,\xf000븀\x0000it's better not to use it.
Shikimi: When writing a story...\xfffethere must be many inputs,\xf000븀\x0000or there can be no output.\xf000븁\x0000Trainers work the same way.\xf000븁\x0000They must battle much,\xfffestudy a variety of things, and\xf000븀\x0000test things out to become stronger.
Shikimi: The Rainbow Wing...\xfffeThe Silver Wing...\xf000븀\x0000They stir up my imagination!
Shikimi: ...The sole Pokémon in the Distortion World\xfffeis such a fantastic spectacle!
Shikimi: ...No matter how much data I collect,\xfffeI haven't a clue.\xf000븁\x0000How old is Cynthia, I wonder?\xfffeWhat do you think?
Shikimi: ...My muffler can give people the\xfffeimpression of looking like a Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000Understand?\xfffeImagination is the key, isn't it?
Cynthia: What is necessary to\xfffebecome stronger from here on?\xf000븁\x0000Might it be an ever-continued \xfffecoexistence with Pokémon?\xf000븁\x0000That is the way I have always been,\xfffeso I can state it to be nothing else...
Cynthia: Once every couple years,\xfffethe Champions of the various regions\xf000븀\x0000should get together and decide\xf000븀\x0000who is the strongest of all!\xf000븁\x0000Don't you think such an gathering\xfffewould be amusing?
Cynthia: I'd like to live here,\xfffebut if I did, my research data\xf000븀\x0000would stack as high as a mountain...\xf000븁\x0000That's right! Cynthia!\xfffeThis time, you shall settle things for good!
Cynthia: I have a problem.\xf000븁\x0000A white swimsuit or\xfffea black swimsuit...\xf000븀\x0000which one better suits me, I wonder?
Cynthia: ...Hm.\xf000븁\x0000It's difficult...\xf000븁\x0000I have so many swimsuits I want\xfffeto wear, it's impossible to choose one...
Iris: Hey, hey!\xfffeHave you seen Cynthia's Garchomp?\xf000븁\x0000It's SUPER CUUUUUTE!!
Iris: I'm gonna go on a cruise\xfffewith uncle Shaga soon!\xf000븁\x0000Hiun City's packed with people,\xfffebut I'll be with gramps,\xf000븀\x0000so Iris'll be a-okay!
Iris: Sometimes I remember\xfffethe village I was born in...\xf000븀\x0000but I don't care a bit!\xf000븁\x0000'Cause leaving has let me meet\xfffeall these people and Pokémon and everybody!
Iris: We're on a BEACH!!
Iris: The ocean is pretty,\xfffeso I always like to dive real deep...\xf000븀\x0000but everybody always worries about me!
Fuuro: I'm good friends with\xfffeCamille and all, but...\xf000븀\x0000Pokémon battles are kinda different!\xf000븁\x0000It's absolutely crucial I make plans\xfffeto counter electric-types!
Fuuro: Shooting through rainclouds\xfffein stormy weather\xf000븀\x0000is quite the spectacle...\xf000븁\x0000I'd like to show it to you someday!
Fuuro: ...I was thinking just now.\xf000븁\x0000Are swimsuits meant to be revealing?\xfffeOr else, to be concealing?
Fuuro: People can even fly to\xfffefar-off Sinnoh with a cargo plane!\xf000븁\x0000I personally love the feeling of\xfffehaving a Pokémon use Fly, though...
Fuuro: Whew...\xfffeSwimming in the sea feels great!
Camille: ...Showing off a Pokémon's charm\xfffeoften takes away the charm.\xf000븀\x0000It's difficult.
Camille: ...Raimon City actually runs on\xfffeenergy provided by electric-type Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000...Not really.
Camille: Constant worry is bad\xfffefor both the body and mind.\xf000븁\x0000At times like that, you have\xfffeto short-circuit your thoughts\xf000븀\x0000to restore your proper mood.
Camille: Without speaking...\xfffeWithout comprehensible language...\xf000븀\x0000Pokémon can convey my feelings\xf000븀\x0000to trainers in place of me.
Camille: When you get right down to it,\xfffeisn't a swimsuit just a piece of cloth?
Aloe: Aren't fossils just amazing?\xf000븁\x0000Being dead, they shouldn't be able\xfffeto say a thing, yet they tell us\xf000븀\x0000all about the age they lived in.\xf000븁\x0000Hahaha... that's a line from\xfffeAraragi's lil' girl, though, 'course!
Aloe: You can use TMs indefinitely, y'know?\xf000븁\x0000If you teach Retaliation to a bunch of Pokémon,\xfffesomeday you should find\xf000븁\x0000just the right Pokémon for it!
Aloe: When I was little...\xf000븁\x0000My pops dug for rocks in the mountains,\xfffeand always used to bring back bones.\xf000븁\x0000My childish fascination for the things\xfffeis what made me become a researcher!
Aloe: That Belle girl came to ask me\xfffeabout Pokémon the other day.\xf000븁\x0000When you want to know more about\xfffestuff you like, you never wear out!
Aloe: Cynthia's a famous\xfffearchaeologist, so, y'know!\xf000븁\x0000We fellow researchers like to talk\xfffeamongst each other, all academic-like!
